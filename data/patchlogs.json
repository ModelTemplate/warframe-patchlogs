  "changes": "We have made some tweaks to last week's reinforcement: the Cycron! If you haven't picked this up yet yourself, the Cycron doesn't have a reload function; it has a recharge function. As of this Update, the Cycron battery recharge delay time is now halved when the mag is not empty. This means monitoring your ammo while feathering the trigger will be a good strategy when using this weapon. \nWe have made some tweaks to older Warframe Auras. As you may know, an Aura's Mod Rank determines how much additional Mod Capacity you get. We've increased the following Auras form 3 Ranks to 5 Ranks. With this change, we also buffed the Auras: \nSpeed Holster has gone from 80% to 120% at Max Rank.\nDead Eye has gone from 35% to 52.5% at Max Rank.\nEMP Aura has gone from 10% to 15% at Max Rank.\nSprint Boost Aura has gone from 10% to 15% at Max Rank. \nRemoved Lua Spy missions from Sortie rotation due to extensive Client loading times on min spec machines. Please note that we are working to fix this and add Lua Spy missions back into the Sortie rotation.\nAdded an extra line to Limbo's Passive description to speak to his Energy gathering in the Rift.\nImproved experiencing memory loss in the Relays. \nChanged \"CANCEL FUSION\" label to \"BACK\" when reaching max rank on a Mod when Fusing and when there are no pending Fusion tasks.\nReprioritzed a few screens in the Relay so that they load faster even when there's a throng of people around and you're competing for IO bandwidth for their loadouts.\nAdjusted the Rift weight of the Cycron beams in Limb’s Stasis to fix performance issues.",
