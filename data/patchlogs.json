  "changes": "Sentient Cores now drop from Conculysts, Battalysts, and Decaying variants. They will drop either an Exceptional (25%) or Intact (75%) Sentient Core. This allows for progression with the Quills outside of the Plains of Eidolon! \nIvara’s Prowl will now only steal from each enemy once total, instead of once per Ivara. Our intent is to mirror how Nekros’ Desecrate also functions, considering the recent movement of Sentient Cores to certain Sentient variants. It’s rewarding to be the warmly welcomed Nekros in an Argon Crystal run, and we hope Ivara will now be welcomed equivalently.",

We want a calculated release of a change that will deliver on giving Sentinels the function of Vacuum, and see how it affects the usage of content in that category. The results are something we'll be sharing as it should be very interesting to everyone invested in this particular topic. The shovel in the ground on this will apply to Sentinels first, but Pets aren't off the table.We're starting with Sentinels to have this contained group of content analyzed. We will be keeping a close eye on how all of you feel about the new vacuum as well as looking at metrics to see how the distribution of sentinel usage changes across the community (right now 80% of you use Carrier)! We will share results along the way as a team, as soon as this Friday on Devstream #81!Carrier’s precept has been automatically changed to Ammo Case - now increases ammunition capacity and converts ammo pickups into ammo for the currently equipped weapon after a short delay.Research it in the Tenno Lab or find it in the Market today!",

Sculptures, which are more valuable, can be completed by socketing in the appropriate types of Stars.Maroo will pay handsomely in Endo for your Ayatan treasures, but she’ll offer more for completed Sculptures. You’ll have to decide whether you want a quick payout or wait for the big prize and complete your Sculpture. If Endo isn’t what you desire most, you can keep your collection on display in your Landing Craft or trade your treasures with other Tenno.Finding Ayatan treasures in regular missions will be rare, but if you’re feeling adventurous, you can speak with Maroo for a special weekly treasure hunt mission that will test your coordination, speed, and mobility. If you enjoy the more leisurely approach to art collecting, you can always have other Tenno do the work for you and acquire your treasure through the trade system. Whatever your method of procurement, once you have a piece of Ayatan treasure, what you do with it will be up to you.- The Void is now an eligible region for Alerts! Alerts that occur in the Void will have a chance to include Void Traces as a reward!\n- Endo rewards in Alerts now scale to enemy level, with values of 80,100, and 150 Endo for Easy / Medium / Hard enemies!\n- You can now select (opt-in to) a ‘Wait For Players’ option when a quickmatch session is not found.\n- The Top 20 winners from the Codex Art Contest 3.0 have been added (more to come)!",

Some weapons, like the Tonbo for example, would strike the Nullifier bubble first, followed by the Nullifier agent in the same strike. However, the damage would only result on the bubble! The weapons can now strike both the bubble and the agent on the same strike, and the agent will take damage as long you are inside the bubble for the attack.\nRemoved in-mission challenges for all Mastery rank tests.\nRemoved two small sections on Nyx Prime that were un-tintable.\nAdjusted the Market icon size of the Akstilleto and Ballistica.\nChanged the way lighting works on Sigils in an attempt tone down excessive bloom.\nSortie Missions can now have more environmental wrinkles, traps, and obstacles within. Stay Alert!\nMade improvements to the animation look and feel of thrown weapons while holding a Datamass.\nAs a result of wanting to reduce the amount of playerbase splitting that the Syndicate Mission rank generation created, we've reduced this to simply have 7 missions per Syndicate.\nAt Rank 1 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 1, 2, 3.\nAt Rank 2 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 2, 3, 4.\nAt Rank 3 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 3, 4, 5.\nAt Rank 4 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 4, 5, 6.\nAt Rank 5 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 5, 6, 7.\nAs a result, now you are more likely play with other members of the Syndicate at close ranks to you. You will still now have 3 Syndicate missions active in your World state menu, but you should now have more people do them with!\nWarframe Helmet blueprints are now labeled as ‘Neuroptics’. Please note that when trading components, full Warframe sets now contain Systems, Chassis, and Neuroptics (previously Helmet) as components.\nPolished a variety of environment materials that were too bright.\nPolished a variety of old tileset decoration placements and layouts.\nPlayers can now choice to cancel an undesired squad migration if the migration is occurring while in a lobby.\nUpdated certain interactable Orokin Derelict consoles with new meshes.\nImproved your Sentinels responsiveness to catching up to you and staying at shoulder level when you're moving quickly.\nRescue targets can now shoot while following players. Teleport actions will still take precedent over this behavior when making your way to extraction.\nReduced the Syndicate buff FX to help aiming visibiltiy as per:\nIncreased the spawn rate of Rare Crates in The Jordas Verdict to match the Law of Retribution.\nThe Archwing ability stat screen will now show the correct range for abilities depending on context. (E.g. Blink used to show 100m, but in space you are 0.25x scale so distances are effectively 4x as far. So in space Blink will now show 400m. In water ranges are reduced, so Blink will show 39.69m.)\nGave Rescue hostages their own (incredibly generous) cover evaluators so their cover findings don't conflict with their behaviour. Gave them larger vision range so they react to dangers behind / next to them and not just when they get shot by them first.\nImproved finisher hit detection for multiple weapons. Reticles will now flash red when a finisher can be performed and with each hit for multistrike finisher moves.\nMultistrike finisher moves will have their damage split amongst each hit instead of now being delivered all at the end.\nPropaganda Drone damage reduction buffs no longer stack.\nImproved jump detection. Before players could prematurely double jump when just about to fall off a ledge, when falling off a small edge, or when walking down a steep incline. Regular jumps will now be performed in these scenarios.\nImproved Dojo and Liset decoration placement code.\nVauban’s Bastille now works on Corpus air units. (Attack Drones, etc.)\nIncreased the drop rate of Automatic Trigger.\nIncreased the drop rate of Vermillion Storm.\nImproved squad merging code to better facilitate Lunaro matchmaking.\nImproved migration code to better handle migrations occurring during PvP team selection phase.\nArchwing augment mods now display an <ARCHWING> tag to help differentiate them.\nImprove the physics on the Ki Teer Syandana.",

Please be conscious that some areas may appear overly or underlit. We will work to fix up any rough looking spots - feel free to send screenshots are way in bug threads throughout the appropriate subforums.With Inaros, the sands of old have been swept away from U18 Warframe leaving behind a newer, more vibrant U18.5 Warframe. In many respects, 18.5 is a remastered, more HD version of Warframe with months of technical graphical improvements and artistic relighting of many parts of the game (and more to come in subsequent updates). On top of these changes are across the board rendering performance improvements we hope you'll enjoy, keep in mind that your particular hardware may benefit more and benefit less depending on your GPU, resolution and preferred graphics settings.Lighting textures have been reengineered to reduce square compression artifacts and ugly color banding. You may have seen me point this out on past Devstreams.         \nAll PBR materials have been recompressed with a more accurate format, new and subtle details are visible on your PBR'd Warframes, gear and in the environment.             \nReflection Probes have been built through many areas of the game, grounding PBR materials with more accurate lighting.        \nCharacter and weapon lighting includes more accurate 'dual specular' lighting which means metallic surfaces are more realistic and fancy looking.      \nHDR rendering has been switched to a compact 32bit format which has improved HDR rendering performance for a wide range of GPUs.               \nTonemapping has been adjusted to use more of the range of lighting content in the game, images have more detail, particularly richer in the darks.        \nMotion Blur and Depth of Field have been re-engineered to run faster and look better, fast moving and defocused objects no longer appear 'cut out' on their silhouettes.          \nDraw order optimizations have been applied to every object in the game, which improves overall performance, particularly in worst-case scenarios.          \nAtmospheric fog effects are now rendering in a separate lighting pass, allowing richer particle effects at distance without being 'erased' by atmosphere.              \nParticle lighting has been improved to more accurately represent the local lighting environment.         \nWind force modelling on many particle systems increase realism as various environmental particles now respond to explosive forces and Warframe powers – you've also probably seen us showcase this in our most recent Devstream.         \nBloom system has been softened and made more seated in the scene. The burnt-out look is replaced with a more subtle and gentle sci-fi glow.         \nPhysics collision, performance and stability have all been improved, as a long-awaited upgrade of Warframe PhysX libraries has been completed.Interception AI ImprovementsEnemies in Interception Missions have been overhauled to help improve the flow of combat over the course of the Mission.  These improvements include:Superior objective finding and hacking agent selection.\nBetter player tracking and more intuitive movement to Squad location.\nEnemies unable to hack (such as MOAs) will no longer move to engage hacking consoles.Conclave Changes & AdditionsRecruit Conditioning has been enabled for all players who are Rank 0-2 with the Conclave Syndicate:\nPlayers who are Rank 0-2 will be matched together in matchmaking.\nEffects from Rare mods are disabled in Recruit matches.\nThis option is turned on by default and can be turned off in the Conclave Liset Console if you want to join matches with Rank 3+ players.\nThe option is disabled and removed for players who are Rank 3+ with the Conclave Syndicate.\nNew Annihilation and Team Annihilation Conclave Map: Orokin Moon.\nAll Capture the Cephalon maps with the exception of Gasworks are now playable in Annihilation and Team Annihilation.\nMesa and Hydroid are now playable in Conclave.\nThe Akzani and Akjagara are now available for use in Conclave.\nNew Mods added to End of Mission Rewards for all game modes:\nRapid Consequence (Sniper) -

After a couple years of talk, we finally were able to set up a Test cluster which could be accessed externally. This Test cluster housed the many iterations of Update 16 content.For 1 week straight leading up to this update, a group of just under 20 veteran Tenno spent hours and hours each day playing together, giving feedback, finding bugs, and voicing concerns. Each day included tireless attempts at the incredibly difficult Raids, hilarious moments competing in PvP, and general exploration of all things new. This past week has been one for the memory books - about 60+ hours together with veteran Tenno who applied their skill to some of our hardest and most surprising content yet. I loved every minute of it, and I can’t wait to see what we can do for quality with the potential that this Test cluster has opened!Rebecca",

To do this, Vay Hek is using Void Keys and Torsion Beam Generators to force open Orokin portals.We must destroy his access to these portals.

Cumulative exposure to the keys will have detrimental effects on your health, shields and Warframe abilities. Proceed accordingly.The Lotus- Start the event node on Earth.- Play through the mission, defeat the Grineer bosses and destroy the Void Portal Key.- If you want to take the risk, search out resource caches to find high-value items.- Exposure to the Void Portal will begin to affect you.

Changing this option now takes effect immediately (ie: no game restart required).- Made all Warframe components sellable (1000 CR each).- Changed Lotus transmissions to reduce chatter: added delay to Mobile Defense reminders, Heavy Unit transmissions now have a 2 minute cool-down and can occur at most 3 times per mission.- Loki’s Invisibility no longer reduces the volume of dialog and music.- Changed logic that determines visual representation of damage mods on continuous-fire weapons (eg: Synapse, Ignis, etc).The frequency of damage numbers used to be limited by using a minimum damage threshold. Since damage mods increase the rate at which damage accumulates, this would cause damage to be inflicted more often though each damage event would not necessarily be larger. This led to people thinking the mods did nothing because they didn't notice the increased rate at which numbers would appear (an easy mistake for low level damage mods). Similarly, headshots would make numbers appear more often but not necessarily create bigger numbers.Now continuous fire weapons now limit the frequency of damage numbers by using a minimum time between impacts, regardless of how much damage has accumulated. This gives us a lot more control and should make things more obvious for players who are applying damage mods (it's easier to notice that numbers are 5% larger in magnitude vs being generated 5% faster)”",

Note that the total XP earned was 142% of what you saw on the screen – now it will be 200%.Now:Regular weapon kills divide experience evenly between your weapon and your Warframe (50% each).\nKills using a Warframe ability give all the experience to the Warframe (as before).\nSentinel weapon kills divide experience evenly between your Sentinel and its weapon (50% each).\nKills using a precept give all the experience to your Sentinel (as before).\nExperience from other players (shared experience) is split evenly amongst your gear as follows: a quarter goes to your Warframe and a quarter goes to each of your weapons (25% each).

Now, with the tier cycling, this means after the 20 minute mark you will have more chances to earn rewards from all tiers.- Changed tooltip “View Warframe Profile” to “Profile”.- Tweaked Contact to delay showing you the in-session icon until the session details are available and you can attempt to join themFixes:- Nyx’s Absorb will now go affect enemies behind walls or cover.- Fixed Nyx’s absorb not doing damage to Infested Crawlers and Chargers.- Fixed issues with whisper awareness while in game.

  "fixes": "7.7.1 Hot-Fix + \"About Last Night...\":\nSome of you may have noticed our change lists from yesterday were incomplete (/sarcasm).While we are apt to make controversial changes in Warframe until the end of time, it is our intention to be upfront about it*. How else would I maintain this supple flame-singed hue? We are formalizing how the changelists are compiled in the future. We will never be perfect, but we can do better.Here is what 7.7.1 has as well as important notes absent from the prior update:-Chat server upgraded to allow moderation, unified authentication and blunt the hacking attempts.-Increased the curve of AI damage/shields for higher level enemies... but then:-After more testing, toned down those same curves for high level enemies (split the difference).-Reduced simultaneous enemy counts when playing Solo.-Restored missing sounds (Hek).-Rollback frame-rate dependency fixes for automatic weapons (too much fallout, but this is fixed properly soon).-Added more blueprints to Alerts (Alt helmets, Weapon skins).-Increase health, shields and regeneration on Cryo-casket in Defense Mode.-Rare Mods are now... rare. Faction drop tables were boosting probabilities past Common in some cases.-Fix gear becoming unequipped after relogin/return from mission.-Fix default Exalibur appearing on title screen.-Removed work-in-progress loadout preset option (incomplete).*-excluding things we want to surprise you with.About turn-around time: We do not have moderation and customer support 24/7. I think it is heading that way, but it's not there yet. Try to temper \"Wtf no dev response!\" with that in mind.About chat: Chat moderation is ad-hoc, but if you're being a jerk we will warn you, kick you, ban you, then suspend your account. Remember the Tenno ways. Humor and Honor are not mutually exclusive.About difficulty: We are planning more difficulty choice to sidestep the Goldilocks problem here. As much as you think the game is too easy or too hard there is always someone who feels the opposite. Internally we felt the early-game was too hard, the end-game a bit too easy. The longer-term fix is to give players choice since one size does not fit all.Next: Bug fixes of course! This goes in tandem with new hotness. In the next few weeks expect tileset expansion, new weapons and more crazy Mods. Update 8 (dramatic cue: \"Rise of the Warlords\") has also begun which will be a leap forward for Warframe and breathe a sense of life and purpose into Warframe Clans.(Also note the absurd number scheme, don't take 7.7.x as 8 being just around the corner... it is not)",
