  "changes": "The Sacrifice: Update 23:\nWho would have thought that we’d be launching our third cinematic quest. With the ambitious goal of telling Warframe’s story in a way we had never done before, The Second Dream started it all. The moments you shared with us while playing through the quest is a memory all of us at Digital Extremes will never forget. So we thought… wow, we did it… Can we do it again? And so it was, we burned heaps of midnight oil to launch The War Within and experience the roller coaster of feels with you all over again.\nWitnessing your reaction to THE SACRIFICE teaser we showed at TennoCon last year is an emotion we can’t quite put into words. We’re pretty sure you guys shook the convention center and the internet. So we’re absolutely ecstatic that you can now continue your journey as Tenno in the Warframe universe in this new quest.\nFrom all of us at Digital Extremes, thank you for sharing Warframe with us. This once small but growing studio in London, Ontario couldn’t have done any of this without your extraordinary support, Tenno.\nWe hope that you have enjoyed the ride so far. We look forward to seeing what Warframe has in store for all of us as we look toward the future.\nThe Apostasy Prologue left a memento from the Lotus lingering in the Orbiter, calling back to the moment Ballas extended his hand to her. As they faded beyond grasp, nothing but fragmented transmissions from her remained.\nNow, a foreboding vision leads the Tenno to hunt for a savage Warframe. Will you unmask the truth in this mind-bending new chapter of the cinematic storyline? THE SACRIFICE will bring you closer to uncovering what has fallen into shadow.\nTHE SACRIFICE Quest is available after completing The Second Dream, The War Within, Chains of Harrow and the Apostasy Prologue, and will be available in your Codex upon login. Bring your best Warframe and Operator loadouts to face the challenges that await you in THE SACRIFICE .\n\nCurrently, we have exactly 131 screens in Warframe that need an artistic pass to the new style. 8 are done and ready to go \nthey're here today! Themes similar to above are coming for the screens we have completed, and all subsequent screens will inherit whatever UI theme you've chosen (default or other purchased themes).\nWe have also have 2 free Themes specifically tailored for our visually impaired and color blind Tenno: the “Equinox Theme” (B&W theme) and the “High Contrast Theme”! We’d love to get your feedback on them so that we can increase Warframe’s accessibility:\n\nTo change your UI theme, go to your Interface Options and select “UI Customization”.\n\nThere you can also change your Background from the 3 available options:\nEquinox Background\nLegacy Background\nVitruvian Background\nYou can also change the UI sounds from the “Legacy” and “Vitruvian” options.\nPlease see our Developer Workshop for more information:\n\n\nWarframes with unique Ability-driven (Exalted) Weapons can now be separately Modded in your Arsenal! This includes the ability to customize their appearance too!\nExcalibur/Prime’s Exalted Blade \nWe gave the Blade a partial physical design (hilt) so that you can customize its appearance (Energy color is still determined by Excalibur’s)! \nIvara’s Artemis Bow \nMesa’s Regulators \nIf you own or purchase the Mesa Presidio Skin, you will automatically receive the  Presidio Regulators skin to equip onto Mesa’s Regulators.\nTitania’s Dex Pixia + Diwata\nValkyr/Prime’s Talons\nNo customizing since her Talons’ design is all Energy-based!\nWukong’s Iron Staff\nExalted Weapons work in the following ways:\nThey appear in your Arsenal as an unranked moddable Weapon option once you’ve unlocked the Ability. \nAll Exalted weapons use the Mod classes expected for the class of weapon.\nMelee Exalted Weapons have their Stance Mod permanently displayed in the modding UI with access to Combos!\nTitania’s Dex Pixia now uses Secondary Mods! More on that in the Titania Exalted Weapons Dev Workshop we posted at the beginning of this week.\nWhile Exalted Weapons can be ranked, they do not count towards Mastery Rank (with the exception of Khora’s Venari). \nRiven Mods are not generated for Exalted Weapons.\nLimbo's Stasis has been changed to make it more cooperative! Now, Stasis only stops time for Enemies. Limbo's Gear and all Ally Gear will continue to function. But, because complete time-halting for enemies within the Rift is akin to godly power, the duration of the ability has been shortened overall \nfrom base 30 seconds to 15 seconds. This is of course affected by Mods.\nPlease see our Developer Workshop for more information:\n\n\nThe launch of virtual cursor controls on consoles brought many hotfixes to those platforms with much needed changes and improvements. Our first Dev Workshop looked at bringing D-Pad Functionality, while our second, a follow-up Action Plan, looked at what we planned on improving across platforms. Combined, the following changes are now live for our PC controller players:\nD-Pad support is here!  \nRestored button shortcuts in the Arsenal. \nChanged Relic selection windows to preview content on hover. To choose a Relic, simply select it. \nAdded the ability to auto-rotate your Warframe in the Arsenal (using the Right Trigger) while browsing item grid. \nChanged “preview” and “select” to be independent of one another in the Arsenal item selection (separate bindings displayed in bottom right of screen in Arsenal).\nRemoved the need to hold down and drag in order to select a Mod in the Modding UI. Instead, selecting a Mod will make it stick to your cursor like it used to, allowing you to move it with cursor control or D-Pad. Additionally, hitting “back” will deselect the Mod from your cursor without exiting the screen. \nIncreased the size of Star Chart node hitzones when using a controller.\nFixed category switch with controller LB/RB on some screens when hovering over a category button.\nFixed not being able to fish with Classic Controls.\nFixed LB prompt in Ability Menu appearing permanently after opening fishing gear wheel. \nFixed the cursor on controller moving to an arbitrary spot in the Inventory Sort Options drop down.\nFixed cursor automatically snapping to a button on the right side of the screen if a menu is open.\nFixed being unable to rotate your Operator while customizing with the Right Stick when your cursor is hovering over the item menu.  \nFixed being unable to rotate your Operator at all after fast traveling to the Transference room from “Operator” in the pause menu. \nFixed the “X” callout button missing from the Lunaro Practice Mode, which made it appear that the Practice Mode could not be activated. \nFixed button to send Amp Slots as a gift not actually sending the gift when using a controller. \nFixed controller RB and LB loss of functionality after accessing Navigation, opening matchmaking and then pressing B to back out.\nFixed pause menu button on controller causing a brief UI transition to mouse mode.\nThanks to your feedback, we are continuing our work to improve the cursor experience overall. To stay updated on the changes/fixes we are working on, visit our feedback thread here.\nIncreased Excalibur Prime’s Armor from 250 to 300.\nTeralyst, Gantulyst, and Hydrolyst no longer have regenerated Shields immediately after teleporting from being stuck.\nIncreased Titania’s Diwata damage to 200, Critical Chance to 20% and Critical Multiplier to 2x.\nSlightly lowered the Battalyst and Conculyst's base health from 1300 to 1150.\nSlightly reduced the Battalyst's projectile damage.\nYou can now include “&” in your Zaw weapon Entitling.\nGeneral audio polish for Sanctuary Onslaught.\nFollowing what we started in our previous mainline, we’ve made thousands more micro-optimizations to hundreds of scripts, including Warframe Powers, Precepts, Enemy Logic, Weapon Behaviors, Game-Modes, and the UI.\nAncient and Scorpion grappling hooks no longer go through Gara’s Mass Vitrify wall.\nMoved UI Cursor Sensitivity setting from “Controls” to “Interface”.\nMoved Cetus Wisp and Maprico Tree spawn points a bit further away from water volumes in the NW corner of the Plains for gathering ease.\nAfter the target is captured in Capture missions, the level alert levels will automatically turn off after 1 minute, and enemy spawns will stop after 2 minutes.  \nUpdated the LOC for Banshee’s Sound Quake Augment to “Forgoes channeling to create a shockwave that deals 20x damage at the epicenter, gradually weakening as it expands out\".\nStunning or knocking down Conculysts during their whirlwind ability and Battalysts during their omnidirectional laser ability now cancels the ability. \nRemoved Steam controller icons from the list of selectable sets and swapped them with the Xbox One icons.\nRemoved the “Max Enemy Count Reached” message from Simulacrum enemy selector when first opening it and selecting enemies.

  "changes": "Beasts Of The Sanctuary: Update 22.20.0:\nOur lady of poison is taking the center stage with Saryn Revisited 2.0! Yes, that’s right! She has been revisited for a second time, and this time we took a closer look at increasing the fun factor by removing layers of complicated synergies and giving Toxin Lash and Molt a long deserved encore.\nRead all about our intent and full details on the changes in the official Saryn Revisited 2.0 Dev Workshop!\nIncreased Status Chance from 10% to 50% (scales with Ability Strength). \nA meter in the bottom right corner of your screen will show the number of affected enemies and how much damage is being dealt per tick to said enemies.\nRecasting Spores detonates all active Spores and will deal 2x the damage on an inflicted enemy based on the number of active Spores and the current damage per tick. \nVenom Dose Augment: Spores cast on allies temporarily grant them additional Corrosive damage to all attacks.\nAfter casting, Saryn receives a momentary speed boost for a short duration. \nMolt now scales similar to Rhino’s Iron Skin \nAll the initial damage it takes in the first 3 seconds will make it stronger. Any damage it receives after that point will target the absorbed health.*\n*Damage absorbed is shown in a buff indicator at the top of the screen.\n*Once all absorbed damage has dispensed, Molt explodes dealing Toxin damage to nearby enemies.\nNow has a 100% guaranteed Viral Status Effect on damage tick. \nIncreased range from 15 meters to 20 meters (at max rank). \nIncreased duration from 3 to 5 seconds.\nMiasma inflicts double damage on targets affected by Spores. \nWhen recasting on the same enemy it will refresh the tick duration and maintain the Viral Status Effect, but will not stun enemies a second time until the Status Effect ticks have subsided.\nIncreased Saryn’s Armor from 175 to 225 (at rank 30)\nIncreased Saryn Prime’s Armor from 225 to 300 (at rank 30) \nMade some minor FX updates to Saryn’s abilities! \nSpores received a slight improvement to the FX.\nReduced the brightness of Miasma.\nImproved FX to make her Molt cast more pronounced.\nSpores have been optimized and will be much nicer to your CPU! \nSaryn is also coming with a whole new set of sounds voiced by [DE]Danielle!! \nAdded Abilities screen stats for Saryn Molt speed buff & duration.\nWe hope you enjoy experimenting with her changes. We will be watching closely for your first impressions. As always, we appreciate your constructive feedback and encourage you to thoroughly play with the rework before sharing your thoughts: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/957215-update-2220-saryn-revisted-20-feedback-megathread/\n\nIf you recall, we added enhanced Dojo Decorating earlier this year with some other minor changes. Part 2 has arrived, and it brings with it new visuals and a highly anticipated room!\n\nDisappearing platforms!\nDeadly frickin lasers and pressure-pads that you should avoid at all costs!\nDummies you need to kill to complete the course!\nAnd much more!\nAdded 37 Tenno Decorations and 54 Orokin Decorations for your Dojo renovating pleasure!\nAdded new Pigment colors dropped by the following enemies: \nShard Black: Vomvalysts \nTower White: Condrocs \nDevar Grey: Tusk Bombard \nWisp Grey: Skiff Pilot \nMortus Pink: Kuakas\nDid you miss our Dev Workshop!? Read it quickly here \nit's short:\n\nWe have added 'GPU Particles' which replace the no-longer-supported Nvidia PhysX Particles. These GPU Particles can be enjoyed on all Platforms with varying intensity:\nOff/Low/Medium/High... LUDICROUS!\nMany particle FX have been converted, but we will spend some time continuing to upgrade our catalog throughout the year. Our new system is universal, works on almost all GPUs (really old ones might be out of luck), is not locked to a given manufacturer, and is not locked to PC! Console Tenno will receive this next update!\n\nIf you watched Devstream 110, you might already be familiar with our plans to change the Scrambus and Comba. Players can now engage in more cerebral combat with these enemies, using visual cues to take them down:\n\nTheir Nullify aura has been replaced with a power that they can activate in combat. Upon use, it creates an expanding sphere that nuffilies players’ powers, and disrupts them for 2.5 seconds.\n \nSimilar to the way shooting the Nullifier bubble or weak point can interrupt or prevent the aura from spreading, shooting off Scrambus/Comba’s helmet (or killing them) will negate the sphere:\n\n\n\n\nWith today’s update, you are now able to acquire an active Dargyn in the following ways:\nShoot the Pilot, causing the Dargyn to float gracefully to the ground for you to board:\n \nUse Loki’s Switch Teleport on the Pilot, leaving him grounded and confused:\n \nUse a finisher from behind while using Archwing, allowing you to transition from Archwing to Dargyn:\nIn addition to this new mechanic, we have also made the following changes:\nIncreased mounted Dargyn projectile damage from 250 to 450 and increased the clip size from 50 to 75. \nIncreased the spawn frequency of Dargyn patrol and idle Dargyn encounters when roaming the Plains.\n\nImproved Defense Target navigation by shifting the path towards the center of level.\nBuilt additional buildings around the Defense Target path at both Defense locations.\nAdded additional enemy spawn locations for each Defense location, giving AI more of 360 degree attack option.\nAdjusted Turrets within the level.\nAdded additional cover and attack routes for AI.\nThe rail upon which the Defense Tram travels on is now electrified!\nMoved hack panels to easier-to-find places in certain Grineer Shipyard tilesets. Hopefully you won’t get caught in a lockdown, but if you do, it should be faster to find a panel!\nWe now show you what camera is being highlighted in Advanced Mode.\nAdded tool-tips to help you know what's going on with the settings! \nCaptura, Text, now, supports, commas,!\nImproved speed multiplier controls for controllers.\nFixed 'Cinematic Mode' button not re-appearing when swapping settings.\n\n\nThe improvements to Khora keep on coming! We have a number of important fixes that really help with making Khora play better, as well as some changes!\nChanges include:\n\nIncreased the range of Ensnare.\nRemoved the Line of Sight check from Ensnare to make it more reliable. \nRange Mods now affect Whipclaw's AoE radius, but it is capped. \nKhora's Whipclaw can now damage decorations (crates, barrels, etc).\nKhora's Kavat now teleports to a given target instead of pathing there if the target is too far away!\nChanged Khora’s Venari animations from domestic Kavat to Feral Kavat. \nAdjusted a number of Syandanas to fit Khora better.\nTweaked Venari command sounds.\nFixes include:\n\nFixed a weird 'foot shuffle' animation with Whipclaw. \nFixed using Khora’s Whipclaw on a target causing all enemies affected by Ensnare to be released when the target is killed while ensnared. This one was particularly nasty in practice and made her kit feel weak! \nFixed Khora’s Venari getting locked in her Attack Mode when attempting Mastery Rank tests, which can cause failure on stealth tests (MR9 for example). \nFixed infinite re-whipping for Khora's Whipclaw by flailing the camera around rapidly. \nFixed Ospreys not being fully disabled by Khora’s Ensnare.\nFixed Venari freezing in place when entering Cetus from the Plains, and subsequently duplicating if you head back out, eventually leading to a hall of kitty statues.\nReduced explosion radius from 6m to 4m .\nLowered the Tusk Bombard’s base health from 350 to 300.\nFixed smoke trail behind rocket to persist for life of projectile (trail was disappearing after 8s of flight time, making it very hard to see the rocket).\nReduced explosion radius from 10m to 4m.\nReduced lifetime of fire explosion FX from 10s to 7s.\nAdded a damage element to those fire FX \nMinor Heat damage and Heat proc if touched.\nFixed flame trail behind rocket to persist for life of projectile (trail was disappearing after 5s of flight time, making it very hard to see the Napalm).\nMelee attacks (including spin attacks) will no longer sweep through walls or objects. Please read our Dev Workshop for Melee insight!\nNumerous weapons have received the PBR treatment: \nFlux Rifle (original material and the Shock Camo Skin)\nLanka (original material and the Shock Camo Skin)\nGram\nKraken\nMarelok\nGrinlok\nKronen\nKarak\nTwin Gremlins\nBrakk\nSeer \nhas also receive a new scope FX!\nThe Ceramic Dagger has received a new look! Previously it was identical to the Cronus.\nMade nearly 10,000 micro-optimizations to hundreds of scripts including Warframe Powers, Precepts, Enemy Logic, Weapon Behaviors, Game-Modes, and the UI.\nHarrow’s Condemn, Thurible, and Gara’s Shattered Lash (stab) can now be used on ziplines. \nGara’s Splinter Storm now applies a HUD buff when cast on self to help manage when casting on many targets. \nOperators now emit pain grunts when experiencing fall damage.\nEidolon Lures will wait until the Eidolon has fully disappeared to be auto-destroyed, instead of being auto-destroyed when the sun rises at dawn.\nRemoved the ‘Related Items’ tab from Syndicate Offerings because of purchase attempts resulting in script errors. \nOpened even more previously locked treasure walls in the Void!\nYou now spawn in the Observatory upon returning to the Dojo after a mission.\nIncreased door opening speeds on the Grineer Settlement and Grineer Galleon Tilesets. \nPolished the animations of the Steel Meridian and Cephalon Suda Syndicate handshake emotes. \nReduced the frequency of large Grineer Settlement tiles appearing in Extermination missions to help them feel a little less long.\nRemoved legacy loot crates from Void Onslaught tiles that should not have been part of Simaris' simulation.\nIncreased time given by targets in the Round 11 Mastery Rank Test from 3.5 seconds to 5 seconds and added aim assist to targets to make them slightly easier to hit. \nTurned down volume of bullet impacts on player’s Flesh and Shields.\nChanged the “Dead End” message that appears when viewing a Dojo expansion doorway upon hitting the room limit to say “Maximum Room Count Reached”.\nCrouching is now stateful! If you let go of crouch while in a small tunnel, your Warframe will now stand up when it can.You can also now  crouch while parrying.\nUpdated the ambience in the Simulacrum by removing the repeating music loops.\nRevised and improved several Rock and Cave materials and meshes. \nQuality of life changes for Grineer cell doors in Rescue missions.\nChanged the marker on the panel used to move the tram in one of the Grineer Asteroid tiles to use a different icon so it can’t be confused with the main yellow diamond objective marker. \nDisabled Challenges in some quest missions (e.g. “use your first power 5 times”).\nSeveral Corpus Rescue mission Co-Op door improvements and fixes:\nChanged default state to locked where doors were closed to fix spawning issues.\nReplaced markers with new type.\nAdded state icons to all doors.\nAdded a new marker type on panels for consistency.\nAdded activation sound to door context actions.\nAligned door hint with the ground and changed widths to fit doors (some were too wide).\nRemoved panels from opposite side of the door since they're never accessible.\nShortened delay before the door opens when panels are activated.\nFixed context action alignment.\nFixed missing shiny 'destroy' material on consoles.\nFixed door closing after being opened.\nFixed materials on tram door so it doesn't look like a dead end.\nFixed some broken material script properties.\nPolished Harrow’s Idle animations and his Agile/Noble Speargun variant animations. \nUpdated several ability stat descriptors to make them clearer:\nStandardized format across all Warframe ability descriptions.\nE.g. Range (Meters) #  to Range #\nE.g. “Health over Time #” to “Health / Sec #”\nAdded units of measurement to the abilities where appropriate \nM (meters), S (seconds), % (percentage), X (multiplier), etc. \nConverted decimals to whole numbers (e.g. Equinox’s Rest & Rage Wakeup Health Threshold has been changed from 0.5 to 50% for max rank). \nChanged “Range” to “Radius” for several Warframe abilities.\nSyndicate Pickups are now auto-marked on the first pickup! \nRemoved erroneous stats from Sentinel UI (Energy and Sprint Speed).\nLotus is less chatty in Fissure missions! \nShortened and simplified most levels for the Vor's Prize missions, making sure the missions are more suitable for new player navigation. \nAdjusted the Mithra Syandana based on feedback. \nArcane ranks are now on the side of the icon rather than in the 'name' field.\nYou can now purchase multiple copies of Arcane Blueprints in Hok and Quills Offerings.\nIncreased the in-mission volume of Octavia's Horos Sound Pack by .5dB. \nTweaked the Nova Lamia Skin to better match the Steam Workshop images.\nTweaked the Skeiron Zephyr Skin to be more shiny and metallic instead of matte.\nTweaked the emissives of the Excalibur Sentient Slayer Skin.\nTweaked the Maltzur Oculus List Skin to improve the emissive details.\nUpdated naming filter to allow players to use appropriate words that contain inappropriate words, like “assassin”.\nUpdated chat profanity filter to catch profanity with punctuation immediately following it. Those of you who live on the edge and have the filter turned off won’t notice a thing, but there might be a few more asterisks and a few less inappropriate words in chat for our filtered Tenno. \nExodia Contagion’s Infested grenade 30 meter damage multiplier now also takes into account your combo multiplier.\nMoved the Earth Tikal node slightly to not overlap quest text.\nOnslaught mission Credits are now rewarded every 2 successful Zones.

From an originally proposed damage deviator to the now metallic Kavat wielding queen of the Strangledome, her time is now. But, she won’t come easily. For Khora and Venari have been detected in Simaris’ Sanctuary, and it’s his rules that are law there.\n\nA balanced Zaw Strike for Nikana and Staff weapons. A steady blade for steady hands.\nA heavy Zaw Strike for Machete and Hammer weapons. Measure twice, strike once... heavily.\nA light Zaw Strike for Scythe or Hammer weapons. Lightweight, for flash and bite.\nA two-handed Zaw Grip for measured strikes and greater impact.\nA one-handed Zaw Grip for measured strikes and greater impact.\nIn the simulated universe of the Sanctuary, my data-immortals have fought each other countless times. Through this violence, I have studied and documented their true character. But my study cannot be complete without the power of the Tenno, the most powerful specimen in the system  — you. Your duty in this experiment is to kill as many specimens as efficiently as possible. In this chaos, the true nature of these creatures will be revealed... as will yours.”\nMust complete The New Strange quest.\nTalk to Cephalon Simaris at his Sanctuary in any Relay OR select Sanctuary Onslaught in the Syndicate World State Window tab.\nEnter the Conduit to the Sanctuary and maintain Efficiency against increasingly difficult Specimens for 2.5 minutes.\nEach Specimen you kill attributes to your overall Efficiency, with Eximus Specimens attributing more. \nEfficiency Stimulus’ are spawned per zone that each grant 10% Efficiency \nuse them wisely!\nEach zone after the first triggers a 45 second Focus Boost that scales in multiplier (MAX of 16x) \nkill Specimens as fast as you can!\nWhen a zone is complete, Simaris will open a Data-Conduit to a new and harder zone within his Sanctuary.\nEach week Simaris simulates a predetermined sequence of tilesets and Elite Specimens. This Onslaught is not for the leisurely, as Specimens are stronger and Simaris’ rewards for your Elite data mimic your efforts. Fight relentlessly and repeatedly until your fingers bleed \nthis please Simaris.\nNo Gear! The Gear wheel, Specters, and Emotes are disabled in Sanctuary Onslaught and Elite. Strictly no Dancing in Simaris' world. \nSimaris demands only Rank 30 Warframes can compete in the Sanctuary.\nAn overuse of Warframe abilities can skew Simaris’ data. You may find he has different tolerance levels against ultimates than first abilities. You may never even encounter this rule, but if you do, know that it is only temporary. \nEach Conduit entered/Zone advanced removes current buffs, active Warframe abilities, combo multipliers, and resets Energy to the respective base level. Harder enemies from a baseline! \nThe amount of Efficiency Stimulus that spawn decreases the deeper you go into the Sanctuary. Simaris is (somewhat) kind and will always spawn at least 1.\nIncrease your pace! The deeper you go into the Sanctuary the faster your Efficiency drops. \nSpecimens do not drop real-world things like Mods/Resources in Simaris’ Sanctuary. Rewards certainly do exist, though. Focus Boons and Reward Tables (below) aplenty! We are also going to introduce a series of rewards once this launch is out \nthere will be more to come!\nLeaderboards are available based on overall score for both Sanctuary Onslaught and Elite Sanctuary Onslaught that Simaris will reset weekly.\n2 Zones = Rotation A\n4 Zones = Rotation A\n6 Zones = Rotation B\n8 Zones = Rotation C\nRemoved Excalibur’s 3 second cooldown on Radial Blind.\nRemoved Weekly Kills Leaderboards and Leaderboard Top 20 placement notification.

  "changes": "Shrine Of The Eidolon: Update 22.16.0:\nFirst, it's worth mentioning this is largely rooted in improved functionality across the board. We do plan on releasing even more updates soon with further lighting improvements and the 'Build your Own Obstacle Course', so keep checking back for that.\nAnd now, the Remaster!\nWith this Remaster we've aimed to do a few things:\nGive you better decorating tools.\nOffer you more decorations.\nGive you more functionality in the Dojo.\n*Please note that the following items cannot be contributed to the Clan Vault:\nAll Articulas, Displays, and unique items (Neewa's Drawings, etc)\nAmbulas Noggle\nStalker Noggle\nShadow Debt Noggles (Acolytes)\nKuria Statuette\nSacred Vessel\nOro Ornament\nRell’s Donda\nProminence Wisp Totem\nThousand-Year Fish Statuette\nAyatan Sculptures \nwe know many of you enjoy creating monstrous creatures out of Ayatan, but we want to prevent any Endo tears from accidental non-refundable donations. Once everyone familiarizes themselves with this new 'Decorations in the Vault are permanent' we'll loosen this restriction.\nMission type and difficulty level\nPlanet and node\nOpen spots in your squad\nA whole new setting called Controller Interface now allows you to have the option of AutoDetect! AutoDetect will try to detect what you're using, when you use it. So if you prefer the drag-n-drop functionality of the Mods screen, you can keep using a mouse to do that and see the regular keyboard and mouse UI, however, when you next pick up a controller and press a button, the UI will detect that and refresh to show you controller button Icons instead.\nWithin the Controller Interface you can also permanently toggle on/off the controller interface, which forces the UI into either regular (keyboard and mouse) mode, or controller mode (this works separately from auto-detection and Steam Big Picture mode).\nLastly, you can now choose the UI Icon set under the new setting Controller Icon Set. You can choose between XB1, XB 360, PS4, Steam, and AutoDetect (AutoDetect is essentially XB1). However, using a Steam controller will always result in Steam Icons.\nImproved how precisely you can alter the Camera Duration slider (increment by 0.1 when using the arrow buttons next to the slider). This means that the minimum speed for Camera movements is now lower!\nImproved optimization of Advanced Captura Mode.\nThe playing Camera will now stop if you decide to edit a Camera Position while it's playing.\nImprovements for adding/removing Camera Positions while camera is playing in Captura.\nBrilliant/Radiant Shards are not removed from player inventory until the respective Eidolon spawns.\nPlayers can now remove their Shard after inserting it into the Shrine (until the Eidolon spawns, at which point it is removed from their inventories and consumed by the Shrine).\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if a Host migration occurs before the Eidolon spawns.\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if Night ends before the respective Eidolon spawns.\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if players extract from that Plains before the Eidolon spawns.\nVomvalysts no longer drop Sentient Cores when they are auto-'killed' at sunrise.

The Trials lobby is no longer needed!\nIf you need an Arcane refresher, this spoiler is for you!\n\nUpon logging in, all Arcanes installed on Cosmetics/Helmets will be Distilled because Arcanes can no longer be installed on Cosmetics/Helmets.\nOld Legacy Arcane Helmets will keep their Arcane installed but you can not equip the Legacy Arcane Helmet on a Warframe with 2 Arcanes already installed.\nArcanes can only be installed on your Warframe, Operator, Operator Amp, or Zaw.\nYou can install 2 Arcanes per Warframe and per Operator.\nYou can install 1 Arcane on Operator Amps and Zaws.\nYou can now trade Upgraded Arcanes!\nArcanes have received a visual overhaul!

The number of ‘Digs Completed’ is what counts towards the tiered Rewards in the Endless modes, and this change saves you some mental math! \nYou can still see the total Cryotic Excavated on the Mission Progress screen.\nUpon mounting a Dargyn, your Warframe will now become ‘invincible’ and enemies will attempt to destroy the Dargyn first instead of you.\nRemoved the ability to mount a Dargyn during Transference. Although this resulted in an amazing bug where a Warframe would fly away in the Dargyn and do work while you watched from your Operator on the ground, it’s not intended! \nRemoved dust FX on idling

physics, which resulted in Rubble floating in the air if that Petrified enemy died there.\nFixed Ash’s Shuriken applying numerous Slash Status Effects to every enemy (even ones not hit) if in a group together (using Ferrox’s Alt Fire to group enemies closely). \nFixed Zephyr's Tornados remaining indefinitely if player goes into a bleedout and then self Revives.\nFixed markers for Lures and player

  "changes": "Shrine Of The Eidolon: Hotfix 22.13.3:\nBeam Weapon behavior was originally changed to help with performance but as we've made optimizations to the game over time, we can return them to their original status of hitscan weapons with pinpoint accuracy and zero recoil. Or at least we think we can.\nPerfect accuracy and high fire rate is balanced by limited range and damage ramping up from 10% to 100% over 0.8 seconds when firing and decays back to 10% over 1 second after stopping. To help with ammo economy, Beam Weapons consume 0.5 ammo per trace \nunless they are Flamethrowers.\nOnce this launches (hopefully this week on PC), we're hoping for some practical feedback on the changes and your thoughts! It's a bit tricky to grasp the behaviour changes on paper, but in practice it's something you'll be able to detect quickly. Please bear that in mind when replying \npractical feedback will be the needle mover for any tweaks to come.\nWith such a huge change in behavior, comparing new stats with old is like apples to oranges so they are presented on their own below from our designer:\nBeam weapons now state \"STATUS\" instead of \"STATUS / SEC\" in the Arsenal because they can now Status Effect more than once per second (like all other weapons).\nThe Flux Rifle has a new battery charge up and fully charged sound to go with it’s beam rework!\nMinor tweaks to reload timing on Glaxion and Gammacor.\nTweaked the Synapse beam to better represent it’s Corrosive Damage.\nCurrently Multishot Mods do not increase Status chance. Multishot works like all other weapons except the affect is in the same spot as the base occurrence. We are monitoring this closely!\nCernos Prime Alt Fire is now silent as intended.\nIncreased the Fire Rate of the Zenith's Alt Fire.\nMade the additional projectiles of Talons and Castanas from Multishot spread in a more uniform/predictable pattern.\nEnabled weapon hit notifications for all projectile based weapons. A visual and audible example can be seen here from Devstream #106: https://clips.twitch.tv/GrotesqueElatedStingrayMcaT\nMap can now be panned halfway off screen\nWhen opening Advanced Map, the player position will be centered on the screen\nThe controller reticle will no longer be movable, instead the right analog stick will pan the Map around\nLeft analog stick now controls Map zoom\nPanning leeway will now scale with zoom level (so the Map can't be dragged far beyond the panning limit when zoomed in too much)\nIncreased the Endo awarded by Simaris’ Daily Synthesis Target by 2x.\nHold-to-Charge Abilities (Ember’s Fireball, Zephyr’s Tail Wind, etc) no longer auto cast when full. Cast now occurs on Charge release.\nAlso, if Energy drops below Charge cost, it will auto cast at the appropriate Charge level.\nCritical Chance, Critical Multiple, and Status Effect Chance now all apply to enemies inside Zephyr’s Tornado.\nLowered particle burst, opacity and particle count on numerous Gantulyst and Hydrolyst abilities in an attempt to alleviate performance issues and reduce visual clutter.\nLowered particle burst for Vomvalyst charge up attacks to alleviate performance issues.\nTweaked Kavat wall attack behaviours to prevent ‘supercat’. \nAdarza Kavat’s Cat’s Eye Critical Chance Buff no longer apply to Operators.\nSmeeta Kavat’s Charm Critical Chance and Energy recharge Buffs no longer apply to Operators.\nUpdated description of the Mod \"Entropy Burst\" to read \"Base Status Chance\" instead of \"Status Chance\".\nPicking up a Syndicate Medallion, Exceptional Sentient Core, or Flawless Sentient Core will now display the same special UI message like when you pick up an Argon Crystal.\nTalking to Onkko will now make all other Operators invisible, just like when you talk to Konzu with a busy crowd closeby. \nWhen customizing your Warframe under the Appearance tab, your Warframe will appear unarmed and idling to make customization easier without going into a blocking/armed stance. \nThe message that appears when you are over the Riven capacity limit will now have options to open the Dissolve screen, purchase Slots, or defer to later instead of having to go into the Dissolve screen first.\nCorrected a texture on the Repala Syandana to make it fully opaque instead of slightly transparent.\nTweaked the Saryn Nita’s Moda Skin to have a more pronounced ‘pulsating’ effect as requested by the creator.\nIgnis and Ignis Wraith are now usable in Conclave.\nFixed players not seeing the ‘killfeed’ when a player has been killed in Conclave.\nFixed not being able to equip the Knightess and Corpra Helmets in Conclave.\n",

  "changes": "Shrine Of The Eidolon: Update 22.12.0yup, Another Mainline!:\nTake your fight to the skies by hijacking unmanned Dargyns in the Plains. If you get caught, it's a footrace against the pilot to board the Dargyn! Use these to aid in your search for the new Eidolons!\n\n\n\n“The Sentient was a deformed creature, sent from some dark fold of distant space, crushing towers and citadels across Earth...”\nUntil meeting its fate in a climactic battle.\n“The device detonated. The Sentient's body shuddered, wracked by a cacophonous energy. Fragments of the Sentient crashed to the Plains and marshes and flatlands...”\nThese fragments are known as the Eidolons -\nmysterious titans that continue to wander the Plains and loom over the people of Cetus.\nMost of you have seen the Teralyst, a beast that rises from the watery depths every night. Legends speak of two more Eidolons that fell to the Plains, dormant for centuries but ever-present in the hearts and minds of the Ostrons.\nEidolon Hunters eager to prove their worth are trying to summon these creatures again. Are you worthy, Tenno?\n\nLegends say the Gantulyst wields an enormous boulder for an arm and radiates powerful beams of Sentient energy. The Ostrons built a shrine in its honor hoping to gain its favor.\n\nThe Ostrons believe the Hydrolyst is an omen of impending natural disaster. Stories describe a distinct, pungent aroma that precedes the arrival of this toxic beast.\n\n\nYou now have options to matchmake for Eidolon Hunts!\nIf you’re worthy, you’ll receive a guaranteed Riven Transmuter from the Hydrolyst (if captured). These consumable items can Transmute four Riven Mods into a brand-new Riven. Combining four Rivens of the same type (i.e Rifle, Melee, Shotgun, etc.) will result in a transmuted Riven of that type.\n\n\nEach Warframe’s stats and ability kits combine into a unique entity that offers different strengths and weaknesses. With 34 Warframes to choose from (and the 35th on the way), a Tenno may find there is no challenge they cannot overcome by making good use of the swiss army knife that their Arsenal offers. Some well-rounded frames do multiple things well, while others greatly excel in specific circumstances.\nWhen reviewing the Arsenal over time, our developers often find themselves asking: 'is this fun?’. That's the most important question to us, from the perspective of both the active player and their three squadmates. We understand the importance of power fantasy, but overbearing abilities can make squadmates feel ineffective by seriously disrupting intended gameplay flow. Conversely, when a Warframe doesn’t do enough, players may simply choose a “better” frame, sacrificing personalization and diversity for efficiency. Neither of these situations are ideal, so let’s shake things up!\nIf you've read the Dev Workshop, a lot of this will look familiar, but there are some minor changes! Our intent remains the same. We relist important information here because our Update notes are much more widely read than Dev Workshops.\nWe are revisiting all weapons and adjusting their stats to fit into some Mastery Rank grouping guidelines based on DPS and Crit/Status split total. With this in mind, we are buffing a lot of the weapons you know and love!\nAgain, a lot of this is as shown in the Dev Workshop, but our Update Notes are more widely read.\n\nSadly, not noted here are BEAM weapons \nthey should be ready soon, but we are revisiting them to be more 'like they used to be' in terms of damage instances over time but with a fixed fire rate. Fire Rate mods and their effects are still being determined. The Beam Weapon Category is simply not ready for this Update, but we are still working on it!\n\nConclave Weapon damage rebalancing has been done separately to account for the changes.\n\nWe calculate DPS based on sustained DPS which also takes Critical and Status values into account so our values may be different than yours!\n\nFor those of you in the Riven Market, please be aware these stats will not affect Riven dispositions. Player popularity / usage stats will continue to be the metric for that.\n\nOur data shows enemy weapons are unaffected by this, but if there are cases you believe to be wrong please note them in an appropriate subforum.\nWe sketched out Mastery Rank groupings of 0-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 and 13-15 for each weapon type with a minimum DPS and amount split between crit and status for each group. Using existing stats, weapons were sorted into the groups. If their stats were too high for their current MR it was raised along with any other properties to match.\nIt's damage places it in MR 10-12 but it's crit and stat split is way too low. MR, status and critical chance is increased to match it's new MR. Increasing status and critical boosts its damage so its reduced down to fit back into the MR group guidelines its original stats dictated\nThe end result is the high performing/popular weapons stats remain untouched outside of being placed into their intended MR group and the rest of the weapons are brought up to equivalency.\n\nProjectile based and low fire rate weapons were given more crit and status allowance when appropriate.\n\nFree weapons like the Dex series have been given Mastery Rank values to match their stats! We know these are grandfathered in inventory regardless of Mastery Rank, it's just for consistency!\n\nSome outliers exist that either don’t meet or exceed their Mastery Rank's allotted DPS and \nCrit/Status split allowance because of additional properties and/or features.\nGrakata \nexceeds Crit/Status split but is extremely inaccurate\nStrun Wraith \nDPS is lower than  its Mastery Rank group but it has forced stagger on hit and high status chance\n\nIf players continue, they earn the credits reward, and the wager target is reset so that they have the opportunity to reach it again for more rewards. If players extract, the game ends and they collect all the rewards they managed to earn. The initial investment fee is only taken away once, regardless of the number of times the reward was earned. If time runs out and players are losing, they forfeit all rewards.\nRequired points per tier are now 50/75/100.\nIncreased the required Index points from 25/50/100 to 50/100/200\nEnemy levels scale half as fast.\nChanged the investment costs from 45k/60k/75k to 30k/40k/50k, and changed the credit returns from 120k/195k/275k to 105k/175k/250k. The amount of profit for each tier remains the same at 75k/135k/200k.\nChanged the rewards to give the total credit return and take away invested credits, instead of combining them into the net profit.\nIncreased Teralyst base level to 50.\nReduced base Armor and reduced base Health of Synovia weak points a bit.\nReduced damage of Teralyst abilities to reflect increased level.\nInverted the Shuffle state to be bright when it's enabled, and dark when disabled.\nResource Drop Chance Boosters now affect Mining and Fishing, doubling the chance to get gems and the base number of fish spawns! (Previously only regular Resource Boosters affected the Plains)\nPrime Vault Bounty Relics in Stage 1 have been moved to be rewarded in Stage 2 and weighted accordingly amongst the other Stages. It’s worth noting that Bounty Stage 5 now yields the highest chance of getting a Vaulted Relic. Our intentions here are to alleviate players abandoning the Bounty after the first Stage.\nResource Theft Incursion and Bounty stage (aka Armored Vault) in Plains now lasts only 2 minutes (was 3 minutes).\nIncreased amount of Lures allowed at once from 6 to 8. Lures that have not been hacked to Tenno faction now get destroyed when their camp is deactivated, freeing up room for a new Lure to spawn when players enter other camps.\nReplaced Relics rewarded from Ghouls with Prime Vault Relics (Lith G2 & Neo E1 replaced Lith T1 & Neo S7).\nFocus Passives now apply immediately upon loading into a mission rather than requiring the brief Operator transition.\nOperators can now interact with Pets on your Orbiter!\nReduced the delay between using a Gear item and spawning Archwing in the Plains.\nZaws and Operator Amps now have a stat in your Profile.\nMastery Rank eligible weapons now appear first with locked weapons appearing below when viewing weapons in the Market and Arsenal.\nPressing and holding the fire button on an automatic weapon during a dodge roll will now begin firing once the dodge roll is complete. It's now consistent with pressing and holding the fire button before doing the dodge roll.\nInterrupting an automatic weapon with quick melee will no longer require the player to press the trigger again; the weapon will now resume firing once the melee attack is done.\nUpdated the Dojo Research completion icon.\nTweaked Dojo Tenno Lab glass to fix bloom issues when using custom Dojo colors.\nWarframes in the Tenno Lab will now spin instead of standing still \nso fancy!\nImproved the coordination of rain and stormy skies in the Plains to fix rain appearing during a clear blue sky.\nReduced head bounce movement in Chroma’s sprint turns.\nForma/Forma Bundle prices in the Arsenal Upgrade screen will now display the discounted price if there's an active sale.\nRelay Chat tab now goes to the right of the squad tab.\nEidolon Vomvalyst Lures now have a new distinctive mesh!\nUpdated mastered icons in Inventory, they are now using the teal version rather than plain white.\nMastered icons now also appear on Blueprints in the Inventory for items that have been mastered.\nUpdated Grineer Settlement icon when used in the World State Window (old one was just a distant screencap of Phobos).\nLowered and reduced marker range for small elevators in Grineer Asteroid tiles.\nPurchasing a Slot or Orokin Catalyst in the Upgrade screen will now auto equip/install. This reduces the amount of prompts you have to go through to equip/install said items.\nHarrow’s emissives will now always be on so you don’t need Penance active to see Energy Colors.\nChroma can no longer jump or sprint when using Spectral Scream.\n\n",

In that time, we will be closely monitoring how reproducible Performance issues may factor into this round and possibly revisit Relic placement.

The Plains are going to get a lot more dangerous at night in an upcoming Update.....\n\nYou can now damage Vay Hek up to 25% of his total Health (was 10% previously) while his Propaganda Drone is active before it shuts off. This will result in less waiting around, and will make Vay Hek in Terra Frame easier to deal with.\nReduced base Armor of Vay Hek in his Terra Frame from 225 to 200.\nGhoul Lore Fragments are simply way more likely to drop within Bounties now.\nGhoul enemies themselves can now also drop the Lore Fragments (and Ghouls always have a chance to appear outside of Ghoul Bounties!).  \nGhoul Bounty tables have received new items including Nitain, Cetus Wisps, and Breath of the Eidolon!\nEquinox's Night-Form 'Mend' now regenerates Shields of Allies as enemies are killed within range.\nIncreased the drop chance of Intact Sentient Cores from Vomvalysts to 100%.\nUpdated description of Kwath (Grip) to properly inform of its stats: \n\"Light weight\" now reads \"Heavy weight\"\n\"increase in speed\" now reads \"increase in damage\"\n\"cost of damage\" now reads \"cost of speed\".\nUpdated the description on Zaw balances to say \"link\" instead of \"counterweight\".\nRemoved the Mastery Rank 2 requirement from the MK1-Furis.\nUpdated the Design Council tips that appear in the loading screen and removed some that don’t apply anymore.\nBounties are now Mastery Rank tiered! In the current system, a player of any Mastery Rank could queue up and join any Bounty, even the highest level ones! In order to avoid a mismatch in experience, we've simply set each Bounty to have a default Mastery Rank. It looks a little something like this: \nWhen the Acolytes are live, players will only see them in the World State panel once they've completed Vor's Prize.\nEidolon Lures now follow both Warframe or Operator rather than just the Warframe. The Lure will also now teleport to the player it’s following if/when it gets too far away/stuck. \nWarframe Specters are now much smarter! If you don't recall, Specters are craftable gear you can equip to summon an AI companion in battle. We've done a general intelligence pass on their proficiency with Weapons, and we've also updated their power-casting logic. Virtually every power is now castable with only a few exceptions! Specters CANNOT cast the following Abilities: Vauban's Minelayer, Ivara's Zipline, Titania's Razorwing, Nekros’ Desecrate and Shadows of the Dead, Excalibur’s Exalted Blade, Valkyr’s Hysteria, Wukong’s Primal Fury, Cloud Walker, and Defy, Atlas’ Petrify and Tectonics, Limbo's entire kit (save for the damage aspect of Banish), and finally Zephyr’s Dive Bomb. \nSecurity cameras now trigger more intelligently, the Corpus have upgraded their software. \nImproved the UI on Defection missions by having instruction text, aligning objectives, and better colour coding for defector icons. \nIncreased duration of Duality Augment to be 10 seconds at Max Rank (affected by Duration Mods).\nSecond Dream now has two vaults instead of three during the first Spy mission.  \nDisabled Stalker, Arc traps, and random transmissions during some quest missions. \nUpdated some doors which still had red non-interactive locked materials to new off versions. \nInstead of redundantly showing both Fire Rate and Charge Rate on bows, they now hide Fire Rate unless comparing to a non-bow weapon. \nChanged the background on selected Tenno customizations to be the same white as when selecting customizations from the Arsenal. \nImproved Sprint/Toggle Sprint so that sprinting stops less often. \nStanding in place with sprint key down no longer causes the sprint posture (for the purposes of Prowl and such).\nWhen a player tries to sell their last Sentinel, a more informative message will appear to explain why it cannot be sold. \nSomachord now continues playing where you left off when you return to your Orbiter.\nSomachord Tones now have their own marker icon when waypointing/finding one in a mission.\nRemoved the \"kill unalerted enemies\" or \"hack 1 terminal\" Challenges from The Law of Retribution and The Jordas Verdict.\nThe War Within Choice Scene has been changed to be untradable.\nTweaked the Cryona Syandana default Tint colors to better match the original Steam Workshop image. \nIncreased the Health of the Loki Specter in the Neptune Junction on Uranus.\nRemoved the equip sound from the Fishing Spear.\nChanged the 'disable sniper scopes' HUD option to be 'use sniper scopes' instead to fit with the positive style of other option wordings.\nIncreased follow radius of Drone in the Drone Hijack Incursion from 30m to 50m.\nLowered health of Grineer Auto Turrets from 1250 to 1100. \nLowered health from 650 to 550 and armor from 100 to 75 of the big Dropship Turret.\nTweaked wording/order in the Landing Craft menu:\nRenamed ‘PLACE DECORATIONS’ to ‘DECORATE’\nRenamed ‘CUSTOMIZE INTERIOR’ to ‘INTERIOR COLORS’\nFlipped the order of those two options\nNox enemies will now react when being damaged by a Stealth attack. Before they would remain not alerted after taking some stealthy damage.\nOperators will now automatically go back into Void Mode after a Void Blast if crouch is still being held (and they have enough Energy).\nReplaced old damaged Liset ship in Vor’s Prize cinematic with new damaged version.\nSabotage missions on Settlement, Shipyards, and Gas City tilesets now have 2 stages.\nThe Arca Plasmor received a change yesterday where headshots no longer deal bonus damage. The Arca Plasmor was designed to hit multiple targets with a high-status chance, but with wide wave projectiles and inherent punch-through, a single shot could result in multiple headshots. With it being a shotgun, it was never intended to behave as a precision weapon, and the bonus pushed it too far out of that mold.\nHowever! While this has changed, headshots should still deal damage (without the multiplier). Currently, there is a bug where headshots deal absolutely 0 damage. This is obviously not intended, and we are working on a fix to resolve this issue.    \nWe apologize for missing this in the original version of the update notes for 22.10.0! As we’ve mentioned before, mainline updates can be a bit rocky (last night’s 4 a.m. ET hotfix for example). Thank you for your understanding.\nConclave Stance Fateful Truth Leading Blade combo now only hits once during the dash.\nConclave Stance Fateful Truth Sudden Spring combo damage reduced.\n",

Enjoy your holidays with some new gear and more while we enjoy ours, and we'll return in 2018 well rested and ready to rock!\nFragments in your Codex are now categorized based on their origin (Cephalon, Cetus, Gara, and Ghouls).  \nYou can now replay Bounties for Standing!\nYou can now use Emotes in your Orbiter! Deep bows all around.\nMirage's Hall of Mirrors casting animation has been changed to match the style of the Mirage Prime trailer! \nRemoved reticle animation when sprinting due to feedback. \nImproved sound ambience and performance on a Grineer Settlement tileset door. \nThe body tendrils on Nezha’s Yaksha Tennogen Skin is now tintable and will take tints from the tertiary slot. \nLieutenant Lech Kril changes: \nLech Kril will now prioritize using his ice abilities instead of melee when he can.\nUpon destroying Lech Kril's backpack, his ice abilities will have their cooldowns reset to reduce time spent waiting around.\nChanged Lech Kril's Ice Wave ability so that it doesn’t halt the fight when players are meleeing him. \nAdded FX to Lech Kril's weakspot that changes tint based on how much damage his backpack has taken to help make the objective clearer to new player. \nVery slightly tweaked hitbox location for backpack to try and achieve more consistent damage. \nWhen Decorating your Dojo, your selected Decoration will now be deselected if you type into the search bar and the Decoration in question does not appear on the results page.

To place, open your decoration tool and select “Warframe Articula”. Once you’ve found the perfect spot, customize by selecting from your existing loadouts, choosing a pose from the “Warframe Gun Pose Set”, and swapping weapons!

  "changes": "Plains Of Eidolon: Update 22.6.0:\nTenno!\nWe’re bringing you what we call a “mainline” update today. This is every fix and QoL change we have been working on since October in addition to content drops. 22.6.0 sets the stage for a bigger end of year Update that includes Khora and more!\nIt’s important to note that sometimes mainline updates can be rocky since they have deep overhauls for optimization within.\nWe will be actively watching for bugs and your feedback on the additions and changes below!\nThe Plains of Eidolon now have changing weather patterns! This new dynamic weather system brings rain, lightning, rolling thunder, as well as fluctuating wind and cloud patterns. The Plains can shift from sunshine to rain (and vice versa) during the day and night, and rain will linger for a reasonable amount of time.\nJumping in puddles isn’t the only good thing about being out in the Plains during the rain! Take advantage of increased fish spawns and reduced visibility for the Grineer while it is raining.\nA rain slider has also been added to the Plains of Eidolon Captura Scene. Adjust the slider from a light trickle to total downpour and capture your dramatic side!\nSince the launch of Focus 2.0 in Update 22: Plains of Eidolon, you have shared your thoughts and suggestions on where we could improve on Operator gameplay as a whole. Focus 2.5 is a reflection of what we’ve learned through your experiences, and acts as a jumping-off point for future implementations that need more consideration before they reach you (daily cap removal for example).\nBelow you will find a breakdown of what has changed in Focus 2.5. If you would like to read more about our intent and motivation for these changes, and some of our future plans for Operator gameplay, head on over to “The Features of Focus 2.5” Dev Workshop thread .\nWe have added shared pool capacity! You can now upgrade your pool size using the points from any School you wish, which increases the maximum capacity for every school all at once.\nYou can increase pool capacity from your active tree. Simply select a School of choice as your “primary” and use its Focus points to increase the shared pool capacity.\nThe ability to increase capacity from within the tree itself still exists, but these points will contribute to the shared pool instead.\nThe costs of unlocking nodes across all trees have, on average, been reduced by almost 30%. The table below compares what a 5 rank passive node (like Zenurik’s Energy Pulse) costs before and after these changes:\n\nVoid Singularity’s pull speed has been doubled.  \nLightning Dash now costs 10 energy per cast.\nGuardian Blast now grants 160 shields at max, up from 100.\nProtective Dash now grants 5s of immunity at max, up from 2s.\nVoid Spines now reflects 100% damage at max, up from 25%.\nStone Skin now adds flat armor, 60 for both Warframe and Operator at max.\nVoid Strike now continues accumulating damage boosts over multiple uses of void mode, each rank adds additional attacks up to a max of 8.\nBlazing Dash now stuns enemies instead of ragdolling.\nWe are excited to see how you feel about these changes, and will be collecting your feedback on Focus 2.5 changes in the dev workshop we posted earlier this week.\nThe following Incursions can now occur in Caves scattered around the Plains: Exterminate, Assassinate, and Cache Recovery. The objectives in these Incursions are the same as they are in the Plains, but there is now a chance for these to randomly take place in caves!\nThe intent of the following changes is to make fishing a more harmonious experience for you and your squad! Until now, Bait, Dye, and Pharoma has only exclusively affected the player who used it. Moving forward, all squadmates will receive benefits from Bait or other fishing consumables in the Plains. The fish you see will still vary from player to player, however, the effects of these consumables will be shared across all members.\nWhen making this change, we also reviewed how each of these consumables worked and tweaked them slightly for the sake of consistency and balance:\nYou can now throw Pharoma and Luminous Dye like Bait!*\nDye, Pharoma and Bait now only work within a certain radius around its casting point. Any player fishing within the radius around this casting point will benefit from its effects.\n*In order for Luminous Dye and Pharoma to work within this system, they are now thrown like bait. They float in the water and affect all fish in the same body of water within a certain radius. This way you can cast out the Dye in one place, and all players will see the fish get highlighted as they swim near it. Multiple Dyes can be used at once, if you want to affect a larger section of the water.\nFinally, we made the following changes and fixes to fishing:\nAdded custom Bait throwing animation.\nActive Bait will no longer be destroyed by fish.\nReduced fish escape speed when spooked.\nFixes towards fish swimming through terrain.\nFixed rare case where fishing Bait would not float properly.\nFixes towards Bait being destroyed if thrown into shallow ponds where the bait would hit the bottom before floating to the surface.\nFixed clients being able to throw one more Bait than they actually have.\nFixed an issue where some fish could swim in the air.\nMass Vitrify is no longer invulnerable and now has sections that break off and explode as it absorbs incoming damage. The amount of damage absorbed scales with Power Strength and Armor. Explosion damage scales with Power Strength. \nMass Vitrify no longer has a duration and remains until recast, destroyed from damage, or smashed with Shattered Lash.\nGara is still relatively new as far as Warframes are concerned but since her release, we’ve found (and many players have found) that an invulnerable and almost impenetrable barrier doesn’t allow for a very engaging gameplay experience. We know that other Warframes also have Powers with similar issues, but adding a shattering component to Mass Vitrify is a change we could easily implement that is consistent with Gara’s glass theme while also making Mass Vitrify more interactive.\nWith these new changes, we can tweak the absorption and explosion values as necessary to make sure Mass Vitrify is both fun and effective. Please keep your feedback constructive and let us know what you think after you’ve had a chance to test these new changes.\nReduced Electric Shield’s Energy Cost per meter to 1 Energy per 4 meters (down from 1 per 1 meter)\nWe previously announced changes to Discharge in this thread. But after further testing, we found that the changes were a lot more powerful than anticipated (we’ve included a video below). As a result, Discharge has not been changed yet. We will continue to work on Discharge improvements before releasing them in a future update. Sorry for getting anyone excited prematurely for Discharge! We appreciate your patience.\nPreviously proposed Discharge changes that ended up with more extreme crowd control than expected \nmodded here for extended range and lower damage. (not live!):\nSpoiler\nReticle will turn blue when targeting allies and red when targeting enemies.\nReticle will show different states for hip, aim and sprint.\nContext actions will dim when aiming while they are active.\nAll non-endless Solar Map and quest missions now display short objective instructions for each stage with a matching marker icon in the UI, similar to those displayed on the Plains.. Some endless missions also have new objective text. \nSimplified and cleaned up any existing objective UI's general alignment, ordering and spacing to make it more readable. \nReworded language in some existing missions’ objective UI for clarity, and added more appropriate text to some timers instead of the generic 'Time'.\nFixed many small consistency issues and bugs with objective markers and replaced some existing mission markers with area markers where appropriate.\nAdded area markers to Hive missions to cover highlight areas where the destroyable tumor nodes spawned around each hive.\nDuring long dialog stages in quests, there will now always be an area marker so that players don't get confused about where they should be.\nChanged timer description in Rescue missions to “Time Limit” instead of “Time Left”. \nIn-world markers for Incursion/Bounty objectives locations will no longer disappear for others when someone reaches it first \nit will persist for players who aren't in the area yet. \nIn-world markers for Incursion/Bounty objectives will reappear if you leave the objective area.\nThe countdown timer when leaving the perimeters of an objective in the Plains has moved to a more visible spot in the UI. It also states that you are “abandoning objective”. \nChanged the marker for downed Capture targets from red to a yellow objective marker \nthis will make it clearer to players that they need to use the context action instead of continuing to damage the target.\nObjective timers are now greyed out when paused.\n'Get to extraction' objective appears on the UI when extraction is enabled (excludes missions where extraction is optional).\nExtraction Timer text changed from 'Time:' to 'Extracting In:' so it can't be confused with other active timers.\nSome missions with large extraction zones like landing pads now use a green area extraction marker. Adjusted some extraction zones so that they fill the whole landing pad and marker area, instead of half of a landing pad.\nRemoved panels from Corpus doors which never did anything to avoid new player confusion because they would light up during lockdowns.\nFixed missing markers on Corpus co-op doors.\nThe Rescue Target in the Plains now has a HUD health indicator located under your mini-map.  \nFixed objective waypoint not disappearing after successfully destroying the Reactor in Sabotage missions.\nFixed Bounty waypoint directing players to extraction when Archwing is immediately deployed upon entering the Plains. \nFixed objective waypoint not disappearing after successfully taking the Vessel from the tomb in the last mission of the Sands of Inaros Quest.\nFixed some Markers being stuck in the at origin on the minimap. \nFixed unlocked icon appearing very dimly on Grineer doors.\nMade performance and memory optimizations to the Plains of Eidolon and other tilesets. If you were experiencing crashes before, we hope that these changes will be the fix!\nThe Corpus Gas City and Grineer Settlement tilesets have received an audio remaster!

It has a similar behavior as hitting a Grineer. Note that projectiles like Quanta cubes do not bounce off Grineer. Thus, cubes will not bounce off the Blunt.\nMiter blades will now bounce off the Blunt.\nImproved the quality of VOIP when Auto Gain Control is enabled.\nIncreased the frequency of spawned Focus Convergence orbs in Defection missions.\nRemoved the ability to be in Sky Archwing in certain Caves in the Plains. \nYou may now notice more populated Grineer bases in the Plains, as roving Grineer now retreat in pure panic back to base at night when the curfew siren sounds.\nTo save you from accidentally Donating your Mote Amp, you can no longer Donate it!\n",

Gold for blood. Blood for gold.\nCetus requires you to earn Standing to unlock rewards from its people. The Daily Standing Cap for Cetus works identically to all other Syndicates, and can be viewed under your Profile!\nAs you venture through Cetus, you will encounter many unique townspeople. Pay close attention to their barks and replies, for each encounter can tell a different story:\nFOSFORs can also be purchased from Nakak!

Be sure to view Hok's Other Services to find out how to make your Zaw (and other Melee weapons) your own!\nThe Plains of Eidolon is an ancient battlefield where Sentients fought to destroy the Orokin Tower that the Ostrons now call home. The Sentients failed and died, leaving behind an ancient graveyard throughout the Landscape. The towering Spectral Sentients known as Eidolons survived the Old War. Every night they ascend from the waters and wander the Plains in search of what they’ve lost. Small, deadly Sentients appear throughout the Plains and protect the Eidolon. At daybreak, they disappear and wait for night to emerge once more.\nThe Grineer have organized drilling stations and sprawling outposts throughout the Plains to excavate the technology of the Old War. Fight Grineer during the day and clear out their bases, but be fast as these Grineer will call reinforcements when they spot danger. As you venture deeper into the Plains, there will be tougher Grineer enemies so come prepared. When night falls, some Grineer will retreat to their camps and attempt to wait it out while reinforcing their outposts and repairing their equipment for the new day.\nSaving your Progress on the Plains happens in a number of ways \nmost of which are automatic!\n\nExperience the great outdoors as you fish in the rivers and streams.

There are 3 reusable fishing spear blueprints available for purchase, each specializing in catching specific types of fish:\nHai-Luk also offers Gear to aid in your fishing efforts, and 4 kinds of Bait Blueprints that may be crafted using components from filleted fish and Resources collected in the Plains.\nBefore heading out into the Plains, add your spear of choice to your Gear wheel in your Arsenal. \nFind a body of water, open your Gear wheel (or use your hotkey), and select your spear to enter fishing mode. \nAiming and shooting with the spear works just as it does when launching other spear weapons.\nAim at an unknowing fish and toss your spear for a chance to reel in your catch!\nUse your equipped Bait by pressing the Alt Fire button.\nBy visiting Old Man Suumbaat in Cetus, you can acquire a Cutter to carve resources straight from the rocks of the Plains. Three different reusable Cutter blueprints can be purchased for Standing:\nOnce you have acquired your blueprint and crafted your Cutter, enter the Plains. The ancient battle has left traces of energy on those Plains, and this affects the Landscape, including the very rock formations! As a result, you will be able to mine interesting and strange mineral deposits with interesting and strange rewards. ‘Arcane Gems’ will be available from this system.

Find it and its blueprint in the Market today!\n\nIt's been almost two years since we released the first version of Focus. Focus comes as a system unlocked upon completion of 'The Second Dream'. After answering a series of questions from The Lotus, you (the Operator) chose a Focus school and began your journey through a series of Passives that you needed to unlock all the while earning the Focus points to do so. Then came The War Within, where your Operator became playable with a few abilities meant mainly to help you earn Kuva and participate in Quests.\nThe core purpose of this rework is to shift the goals of the Focus system away from supplementing Warframes and towards making your Operator more combat-ready. This means that there will be more of a balance between Passives and Actives under Focus 2.0.\nLet's start with some very important facts about all your accrued Focus Points and installed Lenses:\nThe Daily Focus Cap has increased from 100,000 to 250,000 Focus per day.\nConvergence Orbs now yield an 8x multiplier versus a 6x.\nNow we shall talk Passives, Residuals, and Actives.\nActives in their current form on the public build are at the behest of a 100 HP pool for the Operator. The Active and Passive Focus paths in Focus 2.0 aim to increase your Operator’s survivability and to give you the option to approach combat with added Operator support and armaments. Only a few encounters will necessitate this and as the game and feedback grows we will develop accordingly.\nAs far as the Focus Schools themselves, we have clear cut the trees of the old system and are rebuilding entirely new ability paths. We are also including cross-Focus nodes you can unlock within different trees!\nMany benefits of the new Focus trees are linked to the activation of the Operator or Operator Abilities (Void Dash, Void Blast, Void Mode).\nWe have reduced the Pool Increase costs significantly and distributed the Focus point investment more into the nodes.\nOperator AMPS: Operator Weapons!\nTenno who seek out the Eidolon Hunter will be exposed to an Operator Weaponry system.\nOperators will be able to wield a new Modular weaponized system that attaches to their arm, called an AMP. These devices amplify the Operator's Void Beam and Void Blast attacks and channeling them in different ways. They are comprised of three components: the Brace, the Scaffold, and the Prism.\nYou can equip and customize your AMP in the Customize Operator menu aboard your Orbiter.\nTake your Captura to new lengths by purchasing the Plains Scene from Old Man Sumbaat! You'll need to climb the ranks of the Cetus Standing to earn this!\nDefection has been added to eligible Void Fissure missions!  \nAdded a new ‘shield-like’ objective marker to Defense, Mobile Defense, Hijack, and Sabotage missions.\nAdded a ‘Delete All Read Messages’ option in the Inbox. *Please note that this currently does not apply to Community messages.\nAdded a Corpus Outpost and Grineer Shipyard tileset level to the Interception mix for some variation. \nAdded a visual indicator when viewing a Mod that lets you know if you already own it. \nPrettied up materials for several doors in different tilesets. \nAdded a Screen-Shake toggle option! \nAdded two new alternate versions of the default Liset load screens!\nYou can now control if you want to accept gifts from All, Friends Only, or None in the Options Menu!\n",
  "changes": "Warframe Update 22: Plains Of Eidolon:\n\nOur biggest update, ever, Plains of Eidolon has finally arrived! First off, thank you for checking it out!\nIf you're new to Warframe \noh hi! You’ve arrived at an interesting time in our multi-year journey. We hope you’ll stay a while and join our little space-ninja community. Cetus and its open landscape, Plains of Eidolon, have been placed early on in the progression path on Earth so that you can experience them as soon as possible!\nIf you’re a Founder \na Veteran \na Prime Access supporter \nplease know that it is by your hand that this crazy update is even possible. This update is dedicated to you.\nPlains of Eidolon, with its expansive landscape and all-new dynamic game systems, represents the ongoing evolution of Warframe. Our continuing mission: to create a game that feels alive, that challenges its creators and its players alike. A game that lives up to the amazing community that has grown around it.\nSome quick facts you might want to know about how Cetus & the Plains of Eidolon work!\nThe Plains of Eidolon and Cetus operate on a persistent asymmetrical Day/Night Cycle. As the sun rises and sets, different gameplay systems become available! The details are:\nThese Update notes have close to 25 pages of information explaining the Update. The Plains of Eidolon is new for all Tenno \ntake your time and enjoy discovering how to make your way through the systems.\nThere are two energy sources for your Operator: 1 for Void Beam, and another for Void Dash, Void Mode, and Void Blast. Both energy sources regen over time, and energy pickups only affect the latter abilities.\n\n\nTo create more flow with Transference between Operator and Warframe, you can now seamlessly transition to your Operator and back to your Warframe at any time \neven when in mid bullet jump! \nYou can now double tap “shift” to perform a slide as the Operator. \nWhen in Operator mode, Warframes now have a 90% damage reduction from enemies if an ability is active during Transference. If no ability is active during Transference, you Warframe is invulnerable and untargetable.\nFor 2 weeks following the Plains of Eidolon, our first ever Twitch Drops Campaign is live!https://www.warframe.com/news/the-great-eidolon-hunt\nEverything you need to know about this campaign can be found in this handy image:\n\nIf you are wondering who to tune into, see here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/849289-twitch-drops-prep-and-exclusive-sigil-drop/\nPlains of Eidolon has been added to the list of eligible Sortie regions!\nThe Void has been added to the list of eligible Sortie regions! Sorties that occur in the Void will have every mission take place in the Void. \nModular Melee Rivens have been added to the Sortie Reward Pool! These are different from Melee Rivens in that they are made for Zaw weapon combinations.\nKuva (6000) has been added to Sortie Rewards.\nLenses have been removed from Sortie Rewards \nbasic Lenses have been added to Bounties.\nOne of Warframe’s biggest appeals is the diverse selection of weaponry. Even within the subclasses of rifles and pistols, there is huge variety to be found, such as the distinction between projectile weapons (firing physical projectiles which move through space, like the Boltor) and hitscan weapons (firing draws an imaginary line between the gun and the point aimed at, doing damage instantly to whatever it hits, like the Soma). For obvious reasons, hitscans are very effective at long distances \nthis has never been an issue with Warframe’s tileset-based gameplay, but as we shot enemies from a kilometer away in the plains with our pistols, we knew something had to be done.\n \nWith the release of Plains of Eidolon, most weapons will have a form of damage falloff added, to reduce their effectiveness at extremely long distances. But don’t panic! This damage falloff will only be noticeable at extreme ranges (greater than 300m). Across all of our current tilesets, we were unable to find an unobstructed line of sight longer than 300m, so that is the point at which damage falloff will start.\nReticle sway removed from all zoom levels!\n1 meter punch through added to all snipers without any to start with (snipers with innate punch through unchanged).\n1 combo count removed at a time when duration runs out instead of all of them (decay vs. cooldown).\n1 combo count removed on miss instead of all of them\nAdditional bullets from multishot will each count as their own hits and misses in the combo counter\nCombo duration reduced to 2 seconds for all snipers apart from Lanka which is reduced to 6\nDamage fall off begins at 400 meters and ends at 600 meters with damage reduced to 50% past 600 meters.\nFirst level zoom +10% Damage replaced with +30% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +50% Head Shot Damage\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2.67\nFirst level zoom +15% Damage replaced with +35% Head Shot Damage\nFirst level zoom reduced from 4x to 3.5x\nSecond level zoom 20% Damage replaced with +55% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom reduced from 10x to 6x\nNext round is chambered immediately after firing instead of waiting for fire rate to cycle\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2\nFirst level zoom +10% Damage replaced with +30% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +50% Head Shot Damage\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2\nFirst level zoom +10% Damage replaced with +30% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +50% Head Shot Damage\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2.67\nFirst level zoom reduced from 5x to 3.5x\nSecond level zoom reduced from 12x to 6x\nFirst level zoom +15% Damage replaced with +35% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +55% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom reduced from 6x to 4x\nThird level zoom 20% Damage replaced with +70% Head Shot Damage\nThird level zoom reduced from 12x to 8x\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2\nFirst level zoom +15% Damage replaced with +35% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +55% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom reduced from 6x to 4x\nThird level zoom 20% Damage replaced with +70% Head Shot Damage\nThird level zoom reduced from 12x to 8x\nCharge rate decreased from 1.5 to 1\nSecond level zoom reduced from 7x to 5x\nThird level zoom reduced from 12x to 8x\nVasto Prime Mastery Rank increased from 0 to 3.\nVasto Prime damage increased from 60 to 70.\nVasto Prime status chance increased from 15 to 20%.\nVasto Prime critical chance increased from 15 to 20%.\nAll trace fire weapons trace distance reduced to 300m apart from Sniper Rifles which stay at 1000m.\nMagnetic Damage Status Effects now drain energy over time as opposed to completely draining all energy. \nChanged Ayatan Star markers to only display if you're within 100 meters or so range of the drop.. Amber Star markers will also appear larger due to their rarity and to avoid confusion. \nMaroo's Bazaar is now located on Mars.\nAdjusted the Nyx Carnifex Helmet and Skin colors to match original design. \nToned down the density of the Zenistars FX.\nRemoved stagger on hit from Grineer Flameblade units.\nCapture missions will no longer have the chance to change to the Exterminate objective in Kuva Siphon missions.\nImproved the mesh quality of the Angstrum and Prisma Angstrum to avoid blocky textures. \nCompanions will no longer lose integrity if a print is in the process of being distilled to prevent unexpected death.\nChanged metal material assignment for ceilings in the Corpus Tilesets to improve performance. \nImproved Corpus Dropship passenger animations and increased the speed at which they drop the Corpus reinforcements. \nCranked down the intensity of Nox’s helmet smash and explosion upon death sound FX.    \nThe following items are now color tintable:\nAll Vandal and Wraith weapons.\nThe Harkonar Wraith Armour and Syandana.\nUpdated icons for the Lato and Braton Vandal.\nImproved Jat Kusar weapon trail so that it is more visible. \nToned down lens flair on Nekros' idle. \nImproved Operator movement animations in the Landing Craft to remove weird leg and arm motions. \nChanged the TennoGen Knaita Mag skin’s default colors to match the Steam Workshop’s main image.

The blueprints will be removed and if they were under construction, the resources and credits will be refunded (except for the argon crystals for The Limbo Theorem, sorry!).\nAnti-MOAs are now able to spawn in Exterminate and Mobile Defense missions on Jupiter.\nTweaked the glass material on the Orokin capsules in the first mission of Vor’s Prize.\nUpdated Quaro Sugatra’s material rigidness to make it perform more like metal. \nUpdated the Liset’s appearance in the cinematic during the first mission of Vor’s Prize.\nCleaned up a small patch of unintended Infestation on the Corpus Outpost tileset. Looks like those Corpus janitors were really slacking!\nThe Gear wheel can now have up to 12 items!\nThe in-game Market now includes a separate category for Warframe Deluxe Bundles! \nThe Ayatan Star installing prompt will now only display once per Ayatan installing session rather than on every socket. \nImproved Hydroid’s Tempest Barrage when aiming through doorways. The Barrage will better hit the aimed location than the actual doorway. \nTweaked the Hydroid Graxx Skin default colors to better match original design.\nReduced the range at which NPCs see ragdolls / projectiles etc \nthis helps reduce the chance an NPC will see a body a long distance away and become alert.\nOptimized scripts used by Defection missions.\nOptimized the Infested Tar Moa sounds. \nMade many small performance optimizations to all Warframe abilities.\nOptimized Coolant Leak Mod slightly. \nRemoved being able to Quick Revive yourself when dueling in the Dojo.\nThe Sharpened Claws Kavat Mod now only applies the Armour debuff when actually dealing damage.

Inside the vessel, lights flicker and emergency lights strobe. All is quiet except for whispers of “Rap. Tap. Tap,” heard echoing throughout the lifeless craft. What does it all mean? Players must uncover the terrifying reality of what happened onboard, how the Red Veil might play a part in it, and more.\nIf you have completed The War Within Quest and have unlocked the Mot node in the Void the Chains of Harrow Quest will be automatically added to your Codex.\nChains of Harrow Quest is also replayable after completion \nenjoy it all over again!\n\nAlways prepared to sacrifice. This monastic Warframe uses the Void to bolster allies’ defenses and amplify their lethality.\nGet Harrow today by purchasing him in the Market for Platinum, or by completing the Chains of Harrow quest and finding his parts! His parts can be found in the Defection mission type, Grineer Fortress Spy missions, and from enemies corrupted by Void Fissures!\n\nPreviewed in the Operation: Ambulas Reborn, 6 Syndicate Weapon Augments are back and here to stay!\nAvenging Truth\nEntropy Detonation\nStockpiled Blight\nVoltage Sequence\nNeutralizing Justice\nDisarming Purity\nHarrow’s signature Primary weapon, the Scourge is a Corrosive spear gun that shoots wave projectiles with high Punch Through and guaranteed Status Effects. Thrown spears attach a bullet attractor to the heads of all enemies within 14 meters, and continues to pulse every 7 seconds and attaches bullet attractors for 3 seconds wherever it has landed.\nHarrow’s signature Secondary weapon, the Knell, has the utility of a sniper with the sight and zoom with the convenience of a pistol. This single round magazine sidearm grants 100% ammo efficiency for 3 seconds (that can be refreshed when active) and 0.5x Critical Damage added per headshot with a maximum of 3 stacks.\nHarrow’s signature Syandana.\n\nAn alternate helmet for Harrow. Find it in the Market or Alerts!\n\n\nReturn to Warframe’s first planet with a completely new look. Earth Remastered offers improved volumetric lighting, a conversion to PBR materials, and a new vegetation system, which create a mood and atmosphere far more advanced than the original January 2014 update did.\nThe new lush forests of Earth are yours to explore. This Update turns the formerly good-looking planet into a stunningly lush, beautifully lit, alive, organically structured environment.\nWe’ve breathed life into Earth’s ambiance by adding a greater variety of unique sounds as you move between the different areas, connecting tunnels/paths, and between the day and night cycle. You can now experience the sounds of more unique wildlife in the lush forest heavy areas, while the overrun Grineer areas focus more on the clunking and chugging of their machinery. With performance gains and a clearer and more focused mix, Earth now offers a higher level of diversity, adding to the overall experience.\nGhastly in appearance and even more unpleasant in combat, Nox is the newest Grineer experiment, a member of a tactical chem-focus unit, and enemy to the Tenno. Seared by an obsession with toxin and wielding a dart weapon that deals Toxin and Impact damage, Nox leaves clouds of deadly toxin whenever he goes. Take caution, destroying Nox’s helmet will release the toxin trapped inside. This Grineer unit is also extremely unstable and will explode in repulsive fashion when killed.\nYou may encounter Nox in enemy level 15 + Grineer missions.\nDual-wield any thrown Melee Weapon and a single-handed Secondary Weapon to destroy your enemies.

Rivens overall now have a 25% chance to be earned from Sorties.\n\nFor the moments where you wish you had a friend (or 3) with you in the Simulacrum to test a build!\n2 new Mandachord instrument packs are here:\nEpsilon Instruments \nElectronic!\nPlogg Instruments \nPop-rock!\n*Find them in your Arsenal for purchase!\nIn order to let you show off Earth Remastered, 3 new Captura Scenes have arrived! These can be obtained in Rare Crates on Earth:\nGrineer Forest Factory Scene\nGrineer Forest Industry Scene \nGrineer Forest Water Pump Scene\n2 Quest related Captura rooms have also been added \nbut spoilers mean we won't say too much. If you've finished Octavia's Anthem, you'll find Cephalon Suda offering a new Room. Once you finish Chains of Harrow, Red Veil will offer a new Captura room!\n\nIf you find joy in neon colors flashing to the beat of killing Grineer, plug in that Razer Chroma and enjoy the show! Please note that Razer Chroma and Warframe compatibility is a work-in-progress and more compatibility will be added as we continue to develop it.\n\n23 existing PC Achievements have been added to our Steam Achievements!

  "changes": "Additions:\n\nAdded Rank display to item browsing, meaning you can now see what rank your gear is in the inventory. As an example, in the scenario of building an Aklex and you have three, one which is Rank 30, you can now see the item's rank in this new display!\nUnlisted 14.6.0 change: There is now a Dojo chat tab when in the Dojo!\n\n\nTrinity's Blessing is now recastable while passive damage reduction is active. This means you no longer need to wait for your Duration timers to expire before being able to recast Blessing.\n\nFirstly, an explanation in intent and next steps:\nDev observed and experienced the uninhibited blinding effect in up to a 60 M Range with several environments coming between Excalibur and targets. This prompted review.\nSecondly, the 14.6.0 changes have all been reverted as they were experimental and not intended to function in the way they did for this brief 12 hour window.\nThirdly, what you can expect down the road is Radial Blind functioning in a way that considers Line-of-sight. The 14.6.0 unintended version suffered from a lot of problems with this approach, and coming will be radically improved line-of-sight checks for Radial Blind. Targets behind cover that can still see Excalibur are blinded. Other bodies won’t inhibit their blindness, but walls will.\n\n\nFirst, a quick brief in the history of changes this Mod has undergone:\nThis Mod was originally fixed to not give a player energy for damage that was never dealt to player. When we added the damage predeath state in Conclaves, etc, the original fix was unintentionally reverted.\nThe 14.6.0 fix resolves issues where Rage + Quick Thinking gave effective permanent invulnerability because energy was being added to pool that was never dealt to player. With this change in mind, the combination of Rage and Quick Thinking may seem less efficient as before due to no longer giving effective invulnerability. The scope of this change is being monitored to ensure the usefulness of these Mods as a combination.\n\n\nChanged loading screen/matchmaking logic to move on if after 10 seconds Client is unable to properly join/connect. Elaboration: Fixes entire squad being stuck on loading screen while waiting for low end PC to load.\nChanged the attack ferocity of Corpus Mine Osprey: before no maximum existed on number of deployed mines, and now there is a maximum of 6.\nRemoved Kubrow roaming in Liset until further notice.\nTweaked performance of Local Reflections code on Dx10 and Dx11 to address potential FPS loss.\nPvP Bladestorm balancing:-Reduced maximum number of attacks to [2, 3, 4, 5] to address issues with players getting stuck in Bladestorm-ed state for up to 15+ hits.-Increased the PvP damage multiplier from 0.1 per hit to 0.5 per hit in an effort to keep damage output in line with previous values.\n",
  "fixes": "\nFixed issue with Captain Vor being unbeatable on Mercury.\nFixed an issue with Nova’s Molecular Prime explosions caused by self-destructing enemies damaging teammates and defense objectives.\nFixed issues with users connecting behind proxies being unable to update the game.\nFixed an issue where Lotus would constantly talk to you at the end of Survival Alerts.\nFixed a game freeze that would occur when attempting to fuse or change mods.\nFixed game freeze when focusing on the categories menu after opening the item browsing screen in Foundry.\nFixed interception console ‘hitswitch’ pushing AI through the terrain on Grineer maps.\nFixed navigation issues that prevented faithful Kubrow from joining in the fight against Lephantis.\nFixed issues with Void missions not pausing when playing Solo and hitting ESC.\nFixed several crashes.\n",

  "changes": "Update 14.5:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPERATION CRYOTIC FRONT\n\nDig for valuable Artifacts!\n\n\n\nA message from a Mystery Associate:\n\n\n\nTenno,\n\n\n\nI do hope you will forgive my concealed identity but dealing in these unsavoury circles demands unusual discretion.\n\nI’m such a big fan of the Tenno, you’ve accomplished so much and with such rudimentary equipment. That’s why I’m concerned about the coming Balor Fomorians. I think we both know your Warframes are simply not sophisticated enough to stop them.\n\nBut I can help you... for a price.\n\nYou see, I have an appetite for the rare and extraordinary and I’ve recently learned of a fine substance known as Cryotic. If you are willing, I will supply the necessary equipment and coordinates for its extraction. In return, I will enlighten you with what I know about technology that could defeat this Balor threat.\n\nTo sweeten the deal I am even willing award bonuses to those of you who exhibit outstanding performance.\n\nI must say, some of you display the inklings of good taste, if our partnership is a success perhaps we will get to know each other better.\n\nRegards,\n\nYour New Associate\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay the new Excavation missions!\n\n\nThe Location of a ‘Scanning Device’ will appear on your minimap for you to locate.\n\n\nCollect Power Cells dropped by enemies, and bring them to the Scanner to activate it and keep it powered. You can track your Scanner’s power in the map on your HUD. If it reaches 0%, the process will stall until power is restored.\n\n\nDefend the Scanner as it searches for a dig site. Once the Scanner has found a site, it will appear on your map. Proceed to that location to find an Excavator that is digging for artifacts.\n\n\nTake caution!  Enemy waves will attempt to destroy the Excavator, and you must defend it. The Excavator will also continue to lose power. As with the Scanner, you must collect Power Cells to keep it activated.\n\n\nOnce the Excavator has uncovered the artifact, you may choose to Extract from the operation or wait for another Scanner and repeat the process.\n\n\nThere are three available Tilesets for this Operation.\n\n\nWhat is CRYOTIC (New Resource)?\n\nUsually found in extreme sub-zero environments, Cryotic instantly freezes anything it comes in contact with.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Excavator is destroyed before it recovers an item, the mission is a failure.\n\n\nThe Operation is on now until Wednesday, September 3 at 12 PM EDT.\n\n\nOperation Cryotic Front is the first introduction of a new mission type that will replace all Survival missions that take place on a terrestrial tileset.\n\n\nThis Operation introduces Cryotic, a new resource that will only be available in the Excavation game mode.\n\n\nAt each of the point levels below and you’ll unlock a new Tileset in the Operation. It’s your choice – continue to dig on Earth or take your efforts to these new areas. Note that each new Tileset will hold more difficult enemies but will provide the opportunity to earn points faster.\n\n\n\n\nWith each successful dig, you will receive an amount of Cryotic based on your performance (100 max.) The more Cryotic you earn, the better the Reward – so dig on!\n\nMore than 500 pts = Event Badge\n\nMore than 1000 pts = Ice Mod Set (4 dual-stat mods)\n\nMore than 3000 pts = Latron Wraith and the Polar Glaxion skin\n\n\n\nNote: The basis for the rewards is your best score in one single run.\n\n\n\n\nThe top three Clans per Clan Tier will receive Gold, Silver, and Bronze Trophies. For Clan Leaderboards, a Clan’s score is the sum of active personal bests.\n\nPlease be aware that people joining clans after the event has started will not contribute to their new clans score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Added new Colour Customization options available through 2 new packs! These packs are brand new colours that can be applied to your current Kubrow patterns!\n\n• Added a base palette pack that includes 5 colors you can play with for 100K credits!\n\n• Kubrows are now in free-roam mode on the Liset!\n\n• Price of DNA Stabilizers reduced from 100k to 75k credits.\n\n• Added a “Consign to the Lotus” button for unwanted Kubrows.  Fear not, the Lotus shall take care of them!\n\n• Additional animations for Kubrow Cubs!\n\n• Added Kubrow filters for Mods.\n\n\n\n\n\nArmor:\n\n• Oberon’s base Armor increased to 150.\n\n\n\nSmite:\n\n• Projectiles that are spawned after impact seek-to-target, not just spawned in direction.\n\n• Speed up projectiles by 50%.\n\n• Forced Radiation proc on the initial target.\n\n• Forced Knock-down on initial target instead of stumble.\n\n• Forced Puncture proc on all enemies hit.\n\nHallowed Ground:\n\n• Allies within Hallowed Ground can not be proc’ed.\n\n• Hallowed Ground will remove all existing procs from Allies.\n\n• Armour boosted by 5/10/15/20% per rank for all Allies on Hallowed Ground, with stacking being explored on multiple casts.\n\nRenewal:\n\n• Switch to toggle ability with smaller base cost and energy per second active drain. All Renewal benefits occur when projectile reaches target ally.\n\n• Boost Heal amount 200/250/300/400 per rank.\n\n• When target is fully healed, remove any active proc effects.\n\n• Allies affected by Renewal have slowed bleedout by 20/25/35/45% per rank. This is affected by duration mods.\n\nReckoning:\n\n• Forced Radiation Proc added to damage on targets.\n\n• Small radial blind added to slam impact, but only for enemies that survive the damage of the cast. This radial blind will be applied to enemies that move into range after it’s been cast and are blinded by the impact of those being slammed by Reckoning!\n\n\n\n\n• Made Vauban's Vortex scale with power range and duration mods.\n\n\n\n\n• Nyx’s Absorb has had it’s passive energy drain significantly reduced from 10 energy per second to 4 energy per second, and instead now has an energy drain based on incoming damage. This drain is 8 energy per 1000 damage. These drainage values are affected with the use of mods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• In an effort to compensate for more useful attribution of XP when triggering a chain reaction with Molecular Prime, the main XP is attributed to whoever started the chain reaction. Before, Nova would take the bulk of the attribution. Now,  the \"weapon and instigator\" carry through the whole explosion chain ( if Player A casts Molecular Prime and Player B blows up the room, Player B gets the kills and XP). Similarly, if Player A casts Molecular Prime to Crowd-Control and then use their slowed state to get a nice bow-shot, Player B get weapon XP.\n\n• Fixed some of the cases where two Nova's casting Molecular Prime would have unexpected results (explosion range and strength were always determined by the Nova who cast most recently).\n\n\n\n\n• Added HUD counter for Rhino Stomp to show how much longer you have left on your CC (and how long to wait until re-stomp).\n\n\n\n\n• Banshee's Sonar, and the Enemy Radar/Sense mods ignore security cameras and turrets.\n\n• Banshee’s Sonar now uses Energy Colour.\n\n\n\n\n• Saryn’s Miasma can now be cast mid-air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Changed FX of Laser Doors when affected by Mirage’s abilities to better indicate you’re safe to run through.\n\n• Update several Foley sounds: more updates to Tenno step, fixed rhythm and step events for wall running.\n\n• Updated Host Election code to work with new squad system (had been disabled since Update 14).\n\n• Added more details to error messages for invitation and join problems (we are hoping that more information will help us isolate any remaining problems with the invitation system).\n\n\n\n",

Specific examples: void turrets, arc traps, Grineer laser sensors above doors, smashable grates & fans.\n\n• Fixed issue with Dex Furis muzzle flash not being customizable.\n\n• Fixed issues with consumables purchased through Arsenal not being automatically equipped.\n\n• Fixed player completing a Rank Up Test and their Mastery Level will not update right away on the Player's Profile Box at the top of the Pause Menu\n\n• Fixed an issue where you could rapidly hit the button to toggle the chat window while transitioning out of any diegetic screen in the Ship UI, and sometimes it would half-open the chat window and leave the screen darkened\n\n• Fixed issue if when the player is in the rail management screen, and they press the pause menu button, the pause menu will open behind the rail management screen.

This also fixes a similar issue with Vay Hek’s beam-zap attack.\n\n• Fixed issues with Sentinel ‘Weapon Slot’ behavior in Arsenal when switching between Sentinels and Kubrows.\n\n• Fixed issues with blank “Trigger” types in the UI for Penta, Castanas and Deconstructor.\n\n• Fixed issues with navigating the UI with arrow keys equipping things unintentionally \narrow key navigation in Arsenal has been disabled.\n\n• Fixed issue where performing any melee action, then using a context action (Hack Console, Revive Ally), would result in an additional melee action after the context action was complete.\n",

In the case of multiple spawned shields, the time for the last spawned one will be displayed (similar to Frost's Snowglobe).\n\nScorpions will now be able to pull players who are ‘off nav’, which means on boxes or other areas off the main path.\nEnemies health is no longer capped at 65535.\n\nAll Crawlers move speed has been increased.\nNew animations for Infested Ancient reach attack.\nElectric Crawler Attack range fixed, now more likely to attack with his lightning.\nLobber Crawler has new effects on his lobbed grenade, making it easier to see.\nInfested Charger move speed increased.\nSuicide Runners will no longer explode on death if killed by melee. The death explosion causes stagger, and damage scales up with their level.\nInfested Leapers: Their leaping attack can be parried to nullify the stagger. Leap damage scales with their level.\nAll Ancients can pull targets (Pull can be blocked or dodged).\nAll Ancients \nbetter anticipation of knockdown attack. It can now be parried to nullify damage and the knockdown.\nToxic Ancients \nDo poison damage and gives all nearby enemies poison damage. Ancient and nearby enemies are resistant to poison and gas damage.\nHealing Ancients \nLinks with nearby allies, any damage they take heals the Ancient up to 150% health, and it scales up to reflect having health > 100%. Also reduces damage that nearby allies take.\nHealing Ancient now has Fossilized health, to be consistent with the other Ancients (was Infested Armour).\nLeaper infested can dodge.\nDisruptor Ancients \nAura that reduces radial and power damage taken by nearby allies. Attack damage energy, rather than completely drain it. Attacks of nearby allies have the same effect.\nThe following bosses have gone through a balancing pass to improve their scaling for groups of high level Tenno, we hope they are a little more challenging!\nGrustrag 3, Hyena Pack, Vay Hek, Jackal, Alad V and Zanuka, Sargas Ruk, Lephantis, and Captain Vor.\nSpeaking to the Jackal, The Jackal had some additional fixes to reduce the amount of stun locking possible and also allowing him to scale better with level. The health of his legs was changed to a % of his total health, which scales up with level, making it harder to knock him into his stun state. His stun timer was also decreased while the damage required to break him out of stun early was also increased and made as a % of his total health rather than a set value.\nMade several changes to the Derelict Survival mission to improve spawning.\nPolished the logic for connecting procedural levels.\nIncreased the number of connectors to increase play space.\nIncreased spawn room chance.\nRemoved tentacle traversal room (Giant open room which branches are navigated) from intermediate spawning, will only occur as dead end.\n\nRemoved the locked door to extraction, as it only limits the available spawn locations within the first 5 minutes.\nIncreased the number of small dead end rooms (caps) which can generate in place of red locked doors, providing more spawn locations for enemies.\nAdded some new small cap tiles for Asteroid, Settlement, Outpost and Galleon tilesets.\nRestructured the Derelict Survival procedural level so it has more small tiles between the main areas.  There are still three larger main areas which have life support capsule spawn points.  \nThe 'stacking' bug was fixed, capsules don't spawn instantly on activating a capsule if the level is full.\nThe first room's capsule spawns are no longer switched off after one use.  Since the first room is reused, each level may now have 2-3 more simultaneous capsules active before it reaches capacity.  Originally the level structure was a little different, disabling spawns was intended to keep players closer to extraction after moving on from the first room.\nAdded infested crawlers to survival enemy spec.\n\nOptimized game memory to improve stability for 32-bit systems and reduce load-times. This optimization includes up to ⅓ less data being loaded on boot.\nCompleting an Alert on a node you have locked no longer unlocks the node underneath.\nRemoved blood/dismembered Grineer from Excalibur's codex entry ...he didn't mean to hurt anyone.\nIncreased decoration capacity in the trophy room for adequate trophy placement.\nChanges to mod art: Decisive Judgement and Tranquil Cleave used the same image, now they don’t!\nChanged Ruk’s image in the “Enemies” section of the Codex.\nChanges to visual effect when Melee killing an enemy while Channeling.\nImproved performance on effects that use the the particle system.\nRevisited Nekros tinting.\nLoki Prime's decoy now holds a Lex Prime!\nMaterial updates to Corpus ship hull Cores.\nMade curved walls larger to better support wall runs in the Orokin Void.\nTweaked the Bow Idle animations on Loki, Mag, Valkyr, and Hydroid Warframes.\nImproved Melee Ground Attack position accuracy.\nTweaked the sound effects for all Warframes entering Smoke Screen.\nImproved the positioning of melee accessories on Boomerang weapons (Kestrel).\nImproved the cast sound effect for Loki's Radial Disarm ability.\nImproved the performance of multiple general environmental effects.\nLimited the max instances of Karak, Soma, and Gorgon fire sound effects.\nLimited the max instances of Cestra fire sound effects.\nLimited the max instances of Dex Furis fire sound effects.\nTweaked the sound effect for Loki’s Decoy cast and spawn in sound effects.\nPlayer's can no longer be staggered when quick Meleeing with the Glaive.\nPolished some of Tyl Regor's animations.\nImproved the cast sound for Volt's Speed ability.\nTweaked the weapon fire sound effects on the Corpus Crewmen and Moa.\nTweaked the weapon fire sound effects on the Dera and Hind.\nTweaked the sounds of the Grineer rifle melee attack sound effects.\nAdjusted the Helmet position of Corrupted Crewmen.\nImproved the performance of the Interception territory area indicator.\nImproved the visuals on Mag's Pull ability.\nLoki's Decoy ability deploy sound effect is now positional and will not be heard by players past a certain distance.\nIncreased the volume of Vauban's power cast sound effects.\nReduced the pitch variance in Axe sound effects.\nImproved the performance of a number of Forest Defense tileset decorations.\nImproved performance on the Torid and Drakgoon Effects.\nReduced the amount of resonance on Axe hit sound effects.\nLimited the instances of Corpus Laser Weapon fire sound effects.\nImproved the performance of a number of Gas City tilesets.\nOptimized a number of lighting assets in the Grineer Galleon tilesets in an effort to increase performance.\nRemoved blood decals from bleeding procs as this caused performance issues on certain terrain sets.\nTweaked the duration and fade on multiple Hydroid ability sound effects.\nOptimized a number of lighting assets in Corpus Ship tilesets in an effort to increase performance.\nImproved the weapon trail visuals on Whip type weapons.\nOptimized the performance of particle effects.\nTweaked the slide animations when holding Great Sword weapons.\nUpdated multiple Warframe dioramas with proper colors.\nImproved the Grineer Hit reactions to Radial Disarm.\nImproved the performance of Ash's Smoke Screen on lower end PC's.\n\n",

  "changes": "The Infested are sounding and looking much more vicious these days! Completely new sounds and animations for Runners, Crawlers, and Chargers have been added into Warframe!\nNew Infested Music added, experience new ambience and battle music when facing the Infested!\nInfested Impedance Aura mod has been changed to be a radial affect around the player instead of the whole map indiscriminately.\nTweaked the position of multiple armor offsets on all Warframes across the board.\nIncreased the number of Orokin Cells received as T3 Survival awards from 1 to 3 per batch.\nCombat music now reduces less of the volume of ambiance and footsteps.\n",
  "fixes": "\n\nOperation: Breeding Grounds!\n\nTenno, we have a problem.\nAlad V has developed a way to direct the spread of the Infestation. Using these newly engineered \"Hive\" organisms, the Infestation is able to corrupt a new ship or colony almost instantly. There are also disturbing reports coming in that the virus has evolved. It is now capable of absorbing and corrupting non-organic beings. Not even the robotic soldiers of the Corpus are safe now. The only way to stop the spread is to destroy these hives.\nWe have just received word of a massive outbreak near Eris. An entire fleet of Corpus ships has been exposed to this new bioplague. Alad V is almost certainly responsible. If Alad V's hives are allowed to gain a strategic foothold here, the Infested will become unstoppable. They will overrun the system in a matter of days. If we don’t put an end to this now, the Corpus, the Grineer, the Tenno...we could all fall in the wake of this horrible scourge.\n-The Lotus\n\n\nOperation: Breeding Grounds will include point structure that allows for rewards based on points earned in ONE SINGLE mission! This will be denoted in the UI in the \"Best\" field under the Operations tab to help you keep track of your current best score.\n6 points: Breeding Grounds badge!\n17 points: Dual Stat Fire Mods!\n48 points: Prova Vandal!\nThe top 3 Clans per Clan Tier will receive Gold, Silver, and Bronze “Breeding Grounds” Trophies! For Clan Leaderboards, a Clan’s score is the sum of the Best Point run for all members.\n\n\nDifficulty of the mission is increased in the following way:\n\nYou will notice a \"Total\" value in the UI under the Operations tab. The higher this number, the stronger the stink and more difficult the missions! All Tenno will begin playing ‘Difficulty 1’ missions with ‘Difficulty 1’ hives! But, this difficulty won’t stay at ‘1’ forever. The Infested can smell the carnage of your missions and will become more and more difficult and aggressive the more Breeding Ground missions you complete. It will take several runs for the stink of the Infested to stick to you. By completing more missions, you will encounter more difficult hives and more difficult enemies! These difficulty increases will allow you to yield higher points in a single run, with endless potential if you want to compete in clan leaderboards!\nNote: grouping together with other Tenno will have an affect on difficulty depending on the level of combined stench!\nEnjoy! We plan on making Hive Sabotage a permanent addition to the game down the road, so let us know what you think!\n\nFixed a number of crashes.\nFixed Conclave bug where Conclave Score check did not occur if you joined a session from your friends list or via invite. This bug allowed users with any Conclave Loadout Value to join any Conclave node, regardless of enforced restrictions (1300 CR loadouts joining 100-150 Conclave Nodes).\nFixed an instance of the camera shake visual effect appearing incorrectly.\nFixed certain Dojo rooms not having message boards above the room management consoles.\nFixed an instance of Fatal Attraction not working correctly for Clients.\nFixed a number of localization issues.\nFixed an issue with Orokin Shield drones breaking when affected by Radial Disarm.\nFixed an issue with players getting stuck in Ash’s Bladestorm.\nFixed an animation ‘pop’ seen when unequipping Gauntlet type weapons.\nFixed an issue with players using their Melee attacks instead of attacking with Hysteria animations during the ability duration.\nFixed an issue with abilities not being properly available if one or more abilities are not currently equipped.\nFixed an issue with Clients leaving Key missions sometimes resulting in the Host losing a key.\nFixed an issue with Clients sometimes being able to throw unlimited amounts of Castanas which they could not detonate.\nFixed an issue with the Large Corpus Exploding Barrel displaying the wrong image in the Codex.\nFixed an issue with conveyor belts in the Shipyards tilesets appearing to rotate in the wrong direction.\nFixed issue where Banshee’s Silence FX does not disappear when the power duration is cancelled by a teleport volume (falling off map and respawning).\nFixed Rubedo Skin not working on Rhino Prime.\n\n",

You may recall the existence of ‘red crits’ from many updates ago, which occurred with no clear formula other than “Synapse!”. Here is some clarity into the new system:\n\nThe brief:\n\nA weapon with a critical chance greater than 100% will receive 2 calculations:\n\n1) a guaranteed critical damage value \nthis normally appears as a yellow value.\n\nThis means:\nIf your rate is 125% you get one guaranteed crit and a 25% chance of a red crit.\n\nIf this Second Crit occurs, you will see a deadly Red crit value!\n\n\nAsh\nBlade Storm has received a rework! Now when the ability is used Ash will conjure up to two separate clones which will go on the attack in addtion to the player! This will allow the player clear out large groups of enemies even quicker!\nChanges:\nMiter base damage has been increased along with the flight speed and proc chance of charged shots\nIncreased Fatal Attraction's range and damage at Rank 4 and 5.\nThe Fatal Attraction precept will now wait until enemies are within range before the pull ability is initialized.\nTweaked the positioning on the Leg Armor accessories for a number of Warframes.\nAdded in an additional range based visual effect on Molecular Prime that should help with distinguishing the distance of targets affected by the ability.\nTweaked the Excalibur Prime Channeling visual effects.\nSpecters will now re-generate Energy over time now so as to allow them to continue to use Powers over long amounts of time.\nPlayer movement is now prohibited at the start of Conclave rounds.\nTweaked the sound effects for the Skana Prime.\nReduced the amount of damage dealt to attacking players when using Reflection in PvP matches.\nTweaked the visuals on Valkyr's Immortal Skin.\nTweaked the sound effects on the Moa Laser Disc gun explosion and Drone Explosion.\nReduced required scans for Grineer Rollers.\nImproved the animations for the Greatsword and Axe animation sets.\nThe first round of Interception missions will now be easier for Solo players with enemies spawning throughout the mission. The difficulty will remain the same when playing with 2-4 players.\nAdjusted the positioning of Chest Armor on Ember, Banshee, Valkyr, Zephyr, Vauban, Saryn, and Nyx.\n\nFixes:\nFixed issues with many Sentinel precepts having their priority subverted by other slotted precepts.

  "additions": "\nNew Enemy Type: Feral Kubrow – After the fall of the Orokin, these former pets were left to fend for themselves. Only the most vicious survived, evolving into deadly pack hunters that now pervade Earth's dense forests. Intensely territorial, the Kubrow will attack any creature unlucky enough to cross their path.\nNew weapon: SYBARIS \nA Tenno-crafted lever action rifle, Sybaris is equal parts elegance and executioner. Find it in the Market or Tenno Research Lab today!\nNew weapon: ANGSTRUM \nCapable of firing multiple rockets at once, the Angstrum is a handheld instrument of destruction. Find it in the Market today for Platinum or Blueprint for Credits!\nNew Warframe Customization \ncustomizable armor pieces! Explore the Daedelus set and the Eos set today! \nGrineer Shipyard Expansion \nCeres has had further missions changed to include this tileset expansion!Ceres \nHapke & Bode are now Capture type missions.\nAdded a Codex entry for Mag Prime.\nIncreased Color Customization options! You can now color your Syandana's and other Accessories separately from your Warframe if you so desire!\nAdded in a new \"Auto Vault Over Obstacles\" option to toggle on or off.\n\n\n",
  "changes": "\n\nBlessing:  On cast, Blessing restores all shields and health. Damage reduction for the duration of the skill is now based on the greatest percentage of health healed (ie:if you have a squad with members whose health you healed 30%, 40% and 90%, all party members will receive Damage reduction at the greatest percent, 90% in this case).  This should make the use of Blessing more reactive, greatly benefiting players that pay attention and monitor party health to maximize its effectiveness.\n\nReduced the time it takes for Trinity's Blessing animation to play.\n-Energy Vampire:  Will now pulse one last burst from the victim when it dies, releasing any remaining energy; this should make the power useful even when the enemy is killed prematurely.\n\n\n-Silence: Is now a radial ranged effect that moves with you. As enemies enter the radius/area, they experience a ‘sonic disturbance’ which they react to. This disturbance deafens the targets and affects their awareness.\n\n-Sound Quake: Players can now control when to deactivate Sound Quake, with the option to toggle it on or off.  Sound Quake will consume energy per second while active.\n\n\n-Absorb: Players can now toggle Absorb on or off.\n\nBoth toggling changes to Nyx and Banshee will give players more freedom instead of being locked in place while the rest of your team runs around.  It should also add a nice element of resource management to both Warframes, rather than being stuck in place at the cost of X energy.\n\nShield: increased size of Volt’s Shield for better team usage.\n\n\nUndertow: will now be toggleable.\n\n\nShuriken now has forced bleed proc.\nBladestorm now has forced bleed proc.\nTeleport now leaves enemy in finisher state.\n\nFurther clone changes to Bladestorm will follow in a future update.\n\n\nChanges to faction logic in Invasion mission on ‘homeworld’ planets. These homeworld planets are indicated by the planet description in game.\nDefender won't go into \"threatened mode\" until they reach somewhere between 33% to 66% ownership. At that point they engage in a more aggressive strategy to win a  majority land value on their homeworld. Once they are back to that value, they will return to normal until another “threatened mode” between 33% and 66% takes place.\n\n\nReduced the amount of motion blur seen from Volt's Speed ability.\nTweaked the Shield Down and Shield Recharge sound effects.\nAllowed the Corpus Rescue Alarm sound effects to now be replayable.\nOptimized a number of light assets in the Orokin Void tileset.\nOptimized the visual effects for Bleeding procs.\nIncreased the visual effects limit for Nyx's Absorb ability to account for duration extending Mods.\nReduced the visibility of Zephyr's turbulence to address performance concerns.\nOptimized a number of lighting assets in the Corpus Outpost tilesets.\nOptimized a number of lighting assets in the  Corpus Ship tilesets.\nOptimized a number of lighting assets in Grineer Asteroid tilesets\nChanged the damage type that is used to calculate the damage of Melee Finishers which will cause Melee Finisher damage to be a multiple much like the way ground hits are currently calculated.\nTweaked the sound effects for many of Hydroid's abilities.\nTweaked the ambient sound effects heard in the Forest tileset.\nTweaked the visuals on the Misa Syandana.\nSet a max limit on the max instances of Frost's Snow Globe sound effects.\nExtended the maximum possible duration on Sound Quake's sound effects to take into account duration extending Mods.\nOptimized the type of collision calculations used on certain Grineer settlement art assets to address performance concerns.\nCeres \nHapke & Bode are now Capture type missions.\nCeres \nKiste is now a Mobile Defense mission.\nMod shown during loading screens will now display the max level Mod stats.\nBlueprint mods are now highlighted to differentiate them from other drops.\nTweaked the visual effects for destroying security cameras.\nVay Hek can no longer be affected by mind control abilities.\nAsh' Blade Storm will now deal multiplied damage based on the current Combo Hit multiplier\nTweaked the reload sound effects for the Afuris\nAdded in a number of HUD timers for numerous Warframe abilities:\nVauban’s Bastille\nVauban’s Vortex\nBanshee’s Sonar\nEmber’s Fire Blast\nTweaked the sounds for Desert Skates.\nOptimized the shading effect on very bright energy colors to help reduce any apparent color bleeding effects.\nImproved the way the Auto-Fuse algorithm would select cores for Fusion. The Auto-Fuse functionality will now attempt to calculate the most optimal amount of Mods to fuse to reduce the amount of overflow and wastage!\nThe Distribute Resource button has how been separated into two separate buttons with distinct functionality. One button will be used for distributing credits and the other will be used to distribute miscellaneous items.\nTweaked the ability and energy visuals on numerous Warframes including Rhino, Frost, Nova, Ash, Banshee, Zephyr, Vauban, Volt and Valkyr.\nAdded in a better quality Swift Death Mod card image.\nImproved the Fusing process for Mods already installed on weapons. You will now receive a prompt informing you that the Fusion process will exceed the capacity on the specific weapons that the Mod is installed on and will ask you whether you would like to uninstall the mod and continue with the Fusion process or cancel the Fusion entirely.  If there are multiple Fusion conflicts these will be displayed sequentially.\nCreated a more robust warning for the last Clan leaving an Alliance informing them that all resources including Solar Rails will be destroyed in the process\n\n\n\n",

  "fixes": "Hotfix 13.2.3\n\nNews:\nHelmets with stat modifications have now been removed from the Market/Alert Cycle. Previously crafted or purchased Helmets with stats have been grandfathered in and will not be affected by this change. Additional Stat-to-Stateless Helmet recipes have been added to the Market for individuals wishing to change their current stat modifying helmets to purely cosmetic versions. To coincide with this change, the ability to trade Helmets has been added into the game as well. While the possible options to execute on this change were many, we do not feel comfortable removing the stats outright from gear players have spent hours and hours waiting for via alerts or spent Platinum on. The agency is in the players hand to remove the stats, and we will monitor to decide if further steps need to be taken.\nAdditions:\nAdded in a number of Loading Spinners to indicating when certain screens are loading in new data.\nAdded in a new Battle Pay Reserve section to the Dark Sector Menu.
