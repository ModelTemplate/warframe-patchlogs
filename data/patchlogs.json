The Bounty will now attempt to procure a spawn location for the Target for 30 seconds, and if it fails, the Bounty will successfully advance. Geometry and split-second timing play into factor here, and failing a Bounty due to unavoidable situations does not grant Konzu his early lunch!\nExiting the Relic selection menu now counts as a non-vote instead of a decline. Previously ‘Exiting’ from the Relic selection screen counted as \"declining\" the mission, which you could not undo unless you left the squad, or the mission is cancelled entirely.\nYou can now trade the Peculiar Growth Mod!\nImproved velocity and friction of small UI button targeting with a controller.\nImproved AI navigation in the Grineer Shipyard tileset.\nReduced the loading/Star Chart percussion loop.",

This is to give players a better indication of how much shields it has left. \nWe now present players with the option to buy a Forma Bundle when using the Upgrade screen to install Forma. \nAdded filters to the Fish inventory screen at Fisher Hai-Luk's shop (Small, Medium, Large).\nAdded distinct icons for Elevator controls going up or down and increased the speed of some Elevators. \nYou can now decide to only allow friend invites from certain groups (All, Friends of Friends, etc). \nYou can now see how many of a given Mod you own if you click it through Chat Linking!\nAdded Time of Day text to the Free Roam node for the Plains of Eidolon!\nAdded Replay Quest option for A Man of Few Words. \nAdded Replay Quest option for Stolen Dreams. \nAdded a small delay when transitioning to jog from run after firing a weapon so you have time to play your fire animation.

  "changes:": "The Arca Plasmor received a change yesterday where headshots no longer deal bonus damage. The Arca Plasmor was designed to hit multiple targets with a high-status chance, but with wide wave projectiles and inherent punch-through, a single shot could result in multiple headshots. With it being a shotgun, it was never intended to behave as a precision weapon, and the bonus pushed it too far out of that mold.\nHowever! While this has changed, headshots should still deal damage (without the multiplier). Currently, there is a bug where headshots deal absolutely 0 damage. This is obviously not intended, and we are working on a fix to resolve this issue.    \nWe apologize for missing this in the original version of the update notes for 22.10.0!

This also fixes issues where the Drone would become stuck on it’s way to the Boil in Operation: Plague Star.\nMade some very simple tweaks to Octavia’s Metronome (basically cut the pixels being rendered for it in half) to improve the performance of the FX, while at the same time reducing a bit of the visual clutter from full rings being around you. \nImprovements towards performance issues that was caused by lingering (yet invisible) reticles even when the respective weapon was no longer being held.",

  "the changes below cover a number of ideas about making hydroid's simply feel better to use, particularly for teams. in the scheme of our 33 current warframes, hydroids role is to be a fun and active way to use the power of water and swashbuckling themes to take on enemies.": "Hydroid has received the PBR treatment! \nHydroid’s base Energy has been increased from 150 to 188 (at Rank 30).\nTempest Barrage now has a charging sound to indicate when the ability is being charged.\nAllies can shoot their weapons into Hydroid's Undertow to transfer half of their damage and distribute it among all enemies in the puddle.\nUndertow damage per second is now a % of the target's max Health.\nUndertow damage per second now scales with the amount of enemies in the pool - more submerged enemies, more damage! \nUndertow now deals Impact damage towards submerged enemies.\nTentacle Swarm’s tentacles now move at a slower rate when enemies are captured in their grasp to improve issues with hard to shoot flailing enemies.\nImproved Tentacle Swarm’s cast sound to sound more aquatic and powerful when charging up.\nImproved Tentacle Swarm when cast on walls/odd surfaces.\nImproved the performance of Tentacle Swarm.\nSentinel abilities are now disabled while in Undertow. This fixes vacuumed items blocking your view and you from pulling in enemies.\nFixed being able to Transference to your Operator when in Undertow. \nFixed Undertow’s Energy drain when moving applying to elevators.\nFixed certain enemies not working properly with Undertow FX (Nox for instance).",

  "changes": "Junctions that used to award Quest blueprints will now directly award the following Quests, thus removing the need to craft them in your Foundry:\nThe Limbo Theorem (Jupiter-Europa Junction)\nPatient Zero (Pluto-Eris Junction)\nHidden Messages (Pluto-Sedna Junction)\nOberon and Oberon Prime have received new visual FX for Hallowed Ground! \nCaptura sessions now include a countdown and voting. \nWith Harrow's enhancement to Criticals, we have slightly tweaked the colour gradient in which Critical hits are displayed. Introducing: Orange Crits! These now occur in between Yellow and Red Crits. Before, Crits became Red when 100% Crit Chance was achieved. Now Crits will be ORANGE  in the 100.01-200% range, and Red will start at 200.01%+! This is solely a visual change. \nPolished Grineer enemy AI vault over, drop down, etc. animations. \nAdjusted skybox lighting in Pluto’s asteroid field.\nCorpus featured in the Valkyr Prime trailer now reflect the new facial feature textures in-game. \nSwapped out an old Grineer console panel with the consistent console panel in the Grineer Asteroid Fortress tileset.\nSmoothed out Stealth and Parry finisher animations. Enemies will no longer pop in front of you and instead will properly align your Warframe with the enemy during the animation.\nLowered Armor and Health for Grineer Drahks.\nFeral Kubrow have had their Armor reduced to 50.\nMade the Cycuta and Verlorum Prime Sigils appear more metallic.\nImproved glass rendering to be more accurate all in the name of good looking glass.\nAdjusted the hitbox size of some of the Grineer units’ shoulder pads so that they don’t block headshots.\nUpdated terminology for Melee combo descriptions for Portuguese and Turkish.\nMade several case changes to text in game.\nChanged Kavat animation looping from laying on side to sitting up to growl, and then lay back down. Essentially, your classic cat behavior - unbothered. \nReplaced an old door in the Derelict tileset with a newer version.\nImproved navigation for enemies in the Corpus Ice Planet and Infested Salvage tileset.\nReduced the countdown when going to a Relay to 5 seconds. \nMade slight adjustments to the stiffness of the Zaikhya Syandana. \nSlightly tweaked Excalibur's Noble stance to have better trigger placement with his fingers. \nKubrow Eggs are now shown in the Inventory screen under the 'Misc' Tab. \nIncreased the elevator speed in Grineer Shipyard Defense missions from 14 seconds to 8 seconds.\nThought the Grakata couldn’t get any better? Well now it’s firepower sounds even more satisfying! We’ve improved it’s 3D sound to use stereo samples, which gives the Grakata a meatier sound when in close proximity to it. This gives ally and enemy Grakatas a more dynamic feel in 3D! Clem will be pleased.\nImproved Excavator placement in Corpus Ice Planet tileset Excavation missions.\nDarvo’s got a new groove with his newly PBR’ed outfit! \nImproved the performance of Frost's Ice Wave Impedance Mod.\nClients will now be able to see the Host's Octavia Mallet Range FX for a few seconds when cast.\nDex weapon muzzle flash will now apply the chosen Energy color instead of mixing purple + Energy color. Previously it was always purple to keep the Lotus muzzle FX visible, but has since resulted in an unpleasant mix of colors. \nVarious improvements to Grineer animations including aiming, crouching, sprinting, and more. Transition animations have also been improved. \nFurther improved and refined language used to describe Ability, Power, and Energy throughout the game’s text.\nMoved Valkyr Prime's Channelling FX to a different tint channel so they show up much better.\nChanged Archwing Rush extraction marker to always path outside its zone to improve pathing flow.\nChanged yellow 'destroy' markers in Corpus Reactor Sabotage missions to red.\nRepositioned node to fix overlap of Natah quest text 'Find the Sentient Fragments' (Cressida) and Caleus on Uranus.\nSwapped Morax and Baal's mission contents (Exterminate and Mobile Defense) on Europa so they aren't adjacent to nodes in other regions with the same missions. \nMoved Europa - Armaros so text isn't so close to the region title.\nChanged Mercury MPrime to Crossfire Exterminate (Infested vs Grineer, was Infested only)\nChanged Europa - Armaros to Crossfire Exterminate (Infested vs Corpus, was Infested only). \nGrineer Scorpions grappling hook now has a lifespan of 10 seconds to prevent lingering grapples from causing performance issues.\nTweaked fleeing enemies in Exterminate missions to flee sooner when you spot them.\nThe Limbo Theorem Excavation missions will now guarantee one of the Blueprints at the end of 3 extractors as an End of Mission reward.\nThe Codex now auto-closes when beginning a Quest without a starting cinematic.\nForma-ing your equipment now brings you back to the Upgrade screen instead of to the   main Arsenal.\nRemoved ability to mark Ayatan Stars since they automatically generate a marker.\nVoid Fissure Excavation missions now require players to crack open a Relic and have successfully-defended one dig site to completion before they can Extract. \nCephalon Fragment markers no longer appear if you have completed the Codex Entry or if you have scanned it in that mission, unless you're the initial marker. \nTweaked Limbo’s Vasiona Skin’s tintmasks at creator’s request.\nUpdated Frost Vojnik Skin’s weathering textures.\nBuffed Avenging Truth’s stored damage to 20/30/40/50% from 10/15/20/25%.\nUpdated a bunch of Kickbot responses based on observations made by the Guides of the Lotus.\nSounds are now occluded when you are not looking directly at their source. This will help when attempting to locate enemies who are closest to you at all angles. \nImproved the emoji icon in the chat window to avoid appearing with rough edges.\nInfested Boiler minions will now target the last target of the Boiler that spawned them.\nAdjusted the World State Window with the ability to display more Alert reward text if needed.\nPolished multiple Agile and Noble idle animations for various weapons.\nPolished single-handed Pistol reload animations, including adding clips to those weapons that did not have one.\nPolished Tysis’ firing and reload animations.\nRemoved stacked color-correction when Melee Channeling to avoid an unsightly bright screen when spamming.\nPolished Octavia’s Agile Animations. \nImproved Condor Dropship pathing behavior in the Ambulas fight. \nCorpus Ospreys can now receive headshots! You may now unleash devastating shots to their “faces”.\nMade several mix improvements to bullet hit and Tenno Shield gaining/loss sound FX.\nDamage numbers linger a little longer now. \nUpdated the visuals of Right-Click menus in your Friends or Clan Menus.\nSpawning enemies in the Simulacrum now prompts a message outlining what enemies were spawned and in what number. This message will also indicate who spawned them in Multiplayer Simulacrum sessions.\nExcavators will stop spawning after extraction is enabled in the Archwing Quest.\nMade small improvements to how idle enemies react to being hit by bullets by unseen attackers. \nActive Kinetic Siphon Traps will timeout after 3 minutes (unless it is tethered to a target). \nMoved asteroid belt in the Star Chart to be beside Ceres because, thankfully, Earth is not surrounded by asteroids - Ceres is!\nThe Chat Window is now accessible during loading screens, but you will be unable to link Rivens or Songs, view Profiles, click Chat Links, or edit Chat Filters when in loading screens.\nMade the floor FX of Octavia’s Metronome smaller for Clients out of respect to players sensitive to seizures as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/802797-octavia-abilities-triggering-epileptic-seizures/\nReplaced Waypoint Markers with new area markers in the second mission of the Second Dream Quest, and updated the objective text to be more descriptive.\nToned down the FX on Puncture Status Effects.\nTweaked cloth stiffness of the Uru Prime Syandana.\nUpdated appearance of Warframe and Weapon Codex entries.\nCodex Relic search now also searches Relic contents.\nDojo instances are now cancelled when no clan members are present.\nAudited head hitboxes to ensure headshots are properly rewarded across all enemy units with applicable heads.",

This node is optional, and is not required to complete Neptune. Since Endurance modes play out with no explicit end, we've made all Index enemies drop all Index exclusive modes so that you can remain in the same Endurance mission without missing out on drops that the enemies don't spawn.\nDecreased the hit box on the Grineer Rollers to better match the visual mesh.\nReduced particles from the Telos Boltace slide attack as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/764794-balance-the-telos-boltace/?page=2#comment-8431700\nRe-arranged Stims to appear together in Dojo Research.\nAdded mini-map marker for Dojo Transporter.\nRemoved bounding boxes of Dojo and Orbiter Decorations, except around Triggerable or Interactive sections of Decorations.

A distance label is also added to this Marker (but will disappear when they are being revived).\nImproved visuals of Grineer Blunt.\nChanged translations on Resource Drone extract button to be singular if only 1 Extractor is ready.\nTweaked the location of a Kuria in the Shipyards!\nThe objective count in Mobile Defense missions will now disappear a couple seconds after all objectives have been successfully completed.\nUpdated Sargas Ruk’s face with wrinkle data so that you can see his anger in all of its wrinkled glory.\nChanged the console action text and its marker to hover over the console screen instead of floating above it in the first mission of Vor’s Prize.\nAdded extra navigation Marker in first mission of Vor’s Prize to make path clearer.\nUpdated the Corpus Turret animations for performance improvements.\nChoosing the default Ash skin for Ash Prime now removes all Ash Prime details.\nImproved cloth physics on several Sugatras (Boloket Sugatra, Scyth Sugatra, Ki'Teer Sugatra, and the Tentacyst Sugatra).\nOptimized numerous Dojo decorations for improved performance.\nImproved AI navigation in a number of Infested Salvage tiles.\nAdded PBR touches to a number of Corpus art objects.\nAdded PBR touches to a number of Dojo art objects.\nAdded PBR touches to numerous Infested Hive art objects.\nAdjusted the difficulty scaling of the Spy Mission portion of Vor’s Prize Quest.\nUpdated a number of Warframe Skin icons to make them all more consistent.\nLowered the specular lightning on the Smeeta Kavat to address ‘plastic’ looking issues.\nImproved the loading times of certain HUD elements.\nAdjusted the lighting in the Perrin Sequence Lunaro map.\nImproved the dual wielding functionality of Sentient enemy types.\nAdded additional Relay flavor NPCs.\nPerformed a lighting pass on the Infested Corpus tileset for improved reflection fidelity.\nDisabled the mini-map during the mountain pass section of The War Within quest.\nTweaked the visuals of the trade offering icon shown above player’s heads during the trade process.\nTweaked the visual appearance of a number of Infested coral art objects.\nUpdated the wrinkle maps seen on the faces of Grineer Marines.\nThe recruiting channel can now be joined while in a PvP lobby.\nImprove the spawning logic of interactive consoles in Mobile Defense matches to ensure a better spread.\nMagnetize used by enemy NPC Mag’s will now have a 1 second delay before the actual ability is deployed to prevent players from instantly 1-shotting themselves when facing these enemies.\nChanged flashing reticule hitmaker to be simulated locally for Clients to provide better visual damage feedback if they have a poor connection to Host.\nFixed an issue with the flashing reticule hitmaker when jumping or Bullet Jumping near enemies.\nFixed an issue with the flashing reticule hitmaker during Vauban’s Vortex, and Nezha’s Blazing Chakram and Warding Halo.\nUpdated NPC idle animations.\nChanged the tints on the default shader for the Latron as it was all dark, and not fitting the icon!\nThe Corpus Ship Tileset has received an ambiance overhaul.\nNote from George the Audio Director: “We wanted to give this tileset an audio refresh because most of the sounds were created over 3 years ago. In that time we have come up with tech that lets us play ambient sounds in a more realistic way and in a way that makes the levels feel more alive. In addition to the new tech, we also created a lot of new sounds that are unique to this tileset, in order to make it feels more Corpus-like.”\nPuzzle push-volumes now affect Warframes with knockdown immunity (Iron Skin, Warding Halo).\nReduced the MASHED Glyph diorama lighting in the Market to improve visibility.\nMade some adjustments to the Invincibility marker in the HUD so that it is more legible.\nRemoved Corpus Ship room that was unintentionally included in the Corpus Outpost tileset.\nImproved melee weapon holster transition animation for the customizable hostler positions to fix snapping.\nMade several optimizations for Relay performance.\nLowered the brightness on Excalibur's Blind cast and Drone Explosion deaths to avoid excessive bloom.\nNavigation panel information (not quest related) will now be hidden when playing through Vor's Prize.\nGrineer Helmets have been given the PBR treatment to better match their bodies!\nLowered the camera level when in the Archwing Arsenal to better view your Warframe.\nChanged Rhino’s Roar to only buff non-Tenno allies with a weapon -- this avoids the confusion when things like the Defense pod would suddenly start glowing strangely when near a Roar.\nUpdated the icons for the Chroma Drevni and Chroma Vojnik skins to include shots of the default Helmet (with the skin colours applied) to resolve confusion.\nChanged the Hostage/Rescue Target's in-world marker border from white to blue to match the icon color.\nImproved scaling and offset of items when viewing them in the Codex.\nChanged Atlas' Rumblers HUD marker from objective to Allied NPC.\nChanged Grineer Galleon tiles used during the Nav Segment phase of Vor’s Prize to show off a more visually interesting/less confusing route.\nCorpus Ship and Infested Ship door caps are now off instead of red.\nTweaked Mesa’s Noble Rifle animation to remove a pop in the movement.\nThe Braton Prime, Braton Vandal, Aklato, Lato Prime, and Lato Vandal have all had their firing sounds remastered!\nYou will now continue to be in a crouched position when jumping while crouching.",

Enemies that are shot with projectiles that are silent and/or without a sound effect will now report a visual perception (rather than doing nothing).

Players who were logging in around the same daily time found that the Kuva Fortress would always be roughly in the same position, and was restricting the variety of Kuva Siphon missions available.\nWhen not connected to Steam and viewing a TennoGen item, the price will now read ‘Workshop Item’ instead of ‘$0.00’. \nChanged ‘Tenno’ to ‘allies’ in the Cat’s Eye Mod description. \nTweaked Nova Asuri Collection description to clarify that the arm/hands FX is not part of the Danavi Syandana, but on cast of Nova’s powers. \nRemoved ability to see Codex information about Relics you do not own. \nRemoved ability to purchase multiple Arcane Distillers from Syndicates since they are now no longer consumed on use.",

The task of regaining 10 Stacks is quickly obtainable, making this consequence for dying too light. Although 15 Stacks is not a huge jump, we’re hoping it’s closer to that sweet spot! \nEntering a Nullifier bubble will now drain down Mutation Stacks the longer you are in the bubble. \nTo increase the visibility of Nidus' Maggots, holding down Nidus’ Virulence will now display a HUD marker on them. Keep in mind that casting Virulence on Maggots cause them to detonate!\nNidus’ Ravenous Maggots no longer auto detonate when feasting on enemies. Previously the Maggots could do a majority of the grunt work and you were able to watch the carnage and gain Stacks at the same time. Now to pop the Maggots you’ll need to cast Virulence on them and rejoice in your hard earned Stack accumulation. It’s also worth noting that with testing by our team, the Stack rhythm before and after this change wasn’t noticed at all. \nImproved the FX of Maggot explosion to better represent the intended area of explosion.\nNidus’ Ravenous Maggots will still attack but no longer latch on other Infested Maggots or Kuva Jesters due to awkward animations.  \nFixed FX, Maggots, & Health regeneration while in Ravenous staying around forever if cast by a Client who leaves.",

All Credit Alerts now have a chance to spawn with a random Fusion Core as well. With this faster Cycling through Alerts, you should see more things you want return faster!\nAdded Operator Customization improvements.

Historically you'd see higher-tier units mid-way through the first round and there would be no escalation after that; you should now see more infantry in the first round and then more support and heavy units if you chose to stay to intercept more transmissions.\nTuned the enemy tables to fix the cases where certain levels were 50% enemies that couldn't capture points (eg: Drones).\nCorrupted Vor in T4 Interception will no longer delay the end of round countdown (just the end of round) so that if he's the last enemy you aren't stuck waiting as long.\nFixed the problem where low-level Interception missions were flooded with Eximus’.\nAdded an Interception Mission to Sedna, Berehynia.",

  "changes:": "First, a quick brief in the history of changes this Mod has undergone:\nThis Mod was originally fixed to not give a player energy for damage that was never dealt to player. When we added the damage predeath state in Conclaves, etc, the original fix was unintentionally reverted.\nThe 14.6.0 fix resolves issues where Rage + Quick Thinking gave effective permanent invulnerability because energy was being added to pool that was never dealt to player. With this change in mind, the combination of Rage and Quick Thinking may seem less efficient as before due to no longer giving effective invulnerability. The scope of this change is being monitored to ensure the usefulness of these Mods as a combination.",

  "Fixes": "PSA: Deployment of Solar Rails was halted on July 15 to prepare for this Update. We will let you know when the regular Deployment schedule returns.\nNew Dark Sectors Conflict has arrived! A new gameplay mode has arrived to replace the existing Solar Rails Conflict missions.  \nChoose which Clan or Alliance you wish to support and play the role of Attacker or Defender on a multi-staged objective mission.\nUp to 4 human players per side, with empty player slots auto-filled by Spectres.\nRank up your mods while you play!\nAre you a Clan or Alliance Tacticition? Find the new SCHEMA customization area in your Orokin Lab today! Using SCHEMAs, you can customize your Clan or Alliance’s Solar Rails by selecting room orders, placing turrets and Specter spawn points! Clan and Alliance members can enter your SCHEMA and contribute to your plans! Applying your SCHEMA to rails not in a Conflict state to have them ready for the next Conflict!\nBattle Pay is now proportionate to your contributions to the mission. For the new game mode, Attackers have to destroy the \"core\", and defenders have to prevent that. The more damage you do (or prevent, as appropriate), the more you get paid.",
  "dynamic music additions:": "Mirage’s Harlequin Helmet\nHydroid’s Ketos Helmet!\nZephyr’s Tengu Helmet!",
  "additions:": "Added support for additional aspect ratios.\nAdded in a graphics option to disable Anisotropic Filtering. This should help with increase performance by approximately 10% on Intel HD Graphics units.\nAdded an ‘accept all’ pending friend requests option as a context action under the accept friend menu.\nAdded a new Animation when you use a Revive in a session.\nAdded all 3 Diorama Winners from the Diorama Contest of days past! Congratulations to Casardis, 9Hopper, and FireTempest. Find the dioramas in the Codex!",
  "saryn changes:": "Molt has received an Art and Effects overhaul!\nMolt now removes Procs and Status Effects when cast.",
  "valkyr changes:": "Hysteria has been reworked with an entirely new animation set and sounds! Activate Valkyr’s Hysteria to play through the new combos and movement set!\nValkyr’s Hysteria now is affected by the melee ‘combo’ counter bonuses! The higher your combo chain, the more damage Hysteria will do!",
  "volt changes:": "Volt's Electric Shield now has a countdown timer. In the case of multiple spawned shields, the time for the last spawned one will be displayed (similar to Frost's Snowglobe).",
  "general enemy changes:": "Scorpions will now be able to pull players who are ‘off nav’, which means on boxes or other areas off the main path.\nEnemies health is no longer capped at 65535.",
  "infested faction changes:": "All Crawlers move speed has been increased.\nNew animations for Infested Ancient reach attack.\nElectric Crawler Attack range fixed, now more likely to attack with his lightning.\nLobber Crawler has new effects on his lobbed grenade, making it easier to see.\nInfested Charger move speed increased.\nSuicide Runners will no longer explode on death if killed by melee. The death explosion causes stagger, and damage scales up with their level.\nInfested Leapers: Their leaping attack can be parried to nullify the stagger. Leap damage scales with their level.\nAll Ancients can pull targets (Pull can be blocked or dodged).\nAll Ancients - better anticipation of knockdown attack. It can now be parried to nullify damage and the knockdown.\nToxic Ancients - Do poison damage and gives all nearby enemies poison damage. Ancient and nearby enemies are resistant to poison and gas damage.\nHealing Ancients - Links with nearby allies, any damage they take heals the Ancient up to 150% health, and it scales up to reflect having health > 100%. Also reduces damage that nearby allies take.\nHealing Ancient now has Fossilized health, to be consistent with the other Ancients (was Infested Armour).\nLeaper infested can dodge.\nDisruptor Ancients - Aura that reduces radial and power damage taken by nearby allies. Attack damage energy, rather than completely drain it. Attacks of nearby allies have the same effect.",
  "boss balancing changes:": "The following bosses have gone through a balancing pass to improve their scaling for groups of high level Tenno, we hope they are a little more challenging!\nGrustrag 3, Hyena Pack, Vay Hek, Jackal, Alad V and Zanuka, Sargas Ruk, Lephantis, and Captain Vor.\nSpeaking to the Jackal, The Jackal had some additional fixes to reduce the amount of stun locking possible and also allowing him to scale better with level. The health of his legs was changed to a % of his total health, which scales up with level, making it harder to knock him into his stun state. His stun timer was also decreased while the damage required to break him out of stun early was also increased and made as a % of his total health rather than a set value.",
  "orokin derelict survival specific changes:": "Polished the logic for connecting procedural levels.\nIncreased the number of connectors to increase play space.\nIncreased spawn room chance.\nRemoved tentacle traversal room (Giant open room which branches are navigated) from intermediate spawning, will only occur as dead end.",
  "general survival changes:": "Removed the locked door to extraction, as it only limits the available spawn locations within the first 5 minutes.\nIncreased the number of small dead end rooms (caps) which can generate in place of red locked doors, providing more spawn locations for enemies.\nAdded some new small cap tiles for Asteroid, Settlement, Outpost and Galleon tilesets.\nRestructured the Derelict Survival procedural level so it has more small tiles between the main areas.  There are still three larger main areas which have life support capsule spawn points.  \nThe 'stacking' bug was fixed, capsules don't spawn instantly on activating a capsule if the level is full.\nThe first room's capsule spawns are no longer switched off after one use.  Since the first room is reused, each level may now have 2-3 more simultaneous capsules active before it reaches capacity.  Originally the level structure was a little different, disabling spawns was intended to keep players closer to extraction after moving on from the first room.\nAdded infested crawlers to survival enemy spec.",
