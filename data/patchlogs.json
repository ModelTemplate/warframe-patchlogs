  "changes": "Empyrean: Kuva Lich Changes 27.1.0:\n\nThe birth of the very first Kuva Lich came just over 3 months ago (October 31 2019)! A copious amount of Additions, Changes, and Fixes have been made in these 3 months; each one of them touching the surface of feedback, but not fully reaching all the way into the depths. Today, that changes!\nIf you watched Devstream #136, the 2019 Player Survey showed us that out of the 27,000+ responses, the Kuva Lich system was the 2019 addition that was enjoyed the least. Many players voiced that the Kuva Lich system got progressively less fun the more time and energy was devoted to it. While finding the line between repetition and progress is one Warframe has struggled with since it’s first day, Liches highlighted some issues we aim to address while walking that line.\nA downed Kuva Larvling will now display an icon of the Kuva weapon that it’s birthed Kuva Lich will possess!\nThis allows players to decide upfront if they want to pursue that weapon by finishing the downed Kuva Larvling, or to ignore and attempt another Lich. The Kuva Larvling will be in this downed state for a max of 30 seconds before it perishes.\n\nYour Kuva Lich will no longer kill you when you fail a Requiem guess, nor will they attempt to break your back. The Parazon stabbing animation will play but the UI will show whether it was a success or failure. Upon receiving a Requiem fail, your Kuva Lich will laugh at you and leave, leaving your back and dignity intact!\n\nYour Kuva weapon duplicates now offer a gradual progression towards a “perfect” Kuva weapon, which would reflect a 60% damage value, if you choose to pursue this path.\nWe’re also looking at other places we could potentially use this mechanic (Railjack, etc)!\nAs you can see, we’ve cracked a few eggs to make this omelette! We look forward to your feedback on these Kuva Lich changes!\n\n\nIncreased Converted Kuva Lich minimum time to 2 minutes.\nIncreased Converted Kuva Lich Damage Per Second with damage bonus upgrade 3x.\nFixed Converted Kuva Liches not using their abilities.\nDoubled the chance of a Kuva Lich to have a Vengeful Ephemera from 10% to 20%!\nKnown Requiem/attempts now also appear in your Parazon Upgrade screen!\nChanged all Kuva Thrall markers to consistently reflect the new icon brought in 27.0.11. This includes the minimap and when waypointing a Kuva Thrall.\nKuva pickup/rewards are now displayed as the fancy banner UI, similar to Argon.\nKuva Liches can no longer be Parazon stabbed as they are escaping. This resulted in invisible animations, and the UI unveiling if your Requiem Mod guess was correct but not registering it, thus not ranking up your Kuva Lich.\nCleaned up visual metal chunks from the Kuva Liches Carapace (Iron Skin) ability.\nYou can now search the Kuva Lich History Codex section by name, Kuva weapon, and Ephemera.\nFixed Lich ‘Ruse’ clones displaying the default Excalibur Helmet on their shoulder instead of the same Warframe Helmet as their owner. \nFixed Nidus Helmet Armor not appearing grayscale on Kuva Liches.\nFixed certain enemy types being allowed to be spawned as Kuva Thralls that shouldn't be.\nFixed cases of the Kuva Lich ping-ponging between locations when engaging its target.\nFixed script error when changing resolution while in the Kuva Lich screen.\n\n\n\n\nA note from our Sound Team: “We recorded many different real guitars to make this electric guitar Shawzin sound heavy.  The sounds are a result of blending these different guitar tones together. Each of the notes has a couple of different variations so when you play it, it will sound like a realistic electric guitar.”\nOmni tool is now available as a Gear item in your Inventory (Archwing Quest completion required)! This allows you to place the Omni tool in your preferred Gear spot for quick access!\nIf you forget to equip the Omni tool in your Gear upon entering a Railjack mission it will still be given to you for the mission.\nIncreased maximum power for Zekti Predator Avionic to 80%, from 72%\nThis Avionic was slightly under-performing its cheaper Vidar equivalent.\n‘Show Equipped’ will now show ranked Avionics that are equipped even when ‘Show Ranked’ is disabled.\nHijacked Crewships now start the reactor meltdown sequence when they reach zero health.\nOrdnance weapon icons now become translucent while in cooldown, and will reflect a timer icon to better indicate it’s current cooldown state.\nChanged Railjack Engine Component rating stats from Kilometers Per Hour to Meters Per Second to be consistent in the equipped stats.\nFixed Railjack Speed stat showing a higher number than your in-game movement speed.\nThis fix needs some explanation. First of all, a bit of trivia, Railjack operates at a different scale than the rest of Warframe. Perhaps some of you have seen space-time breaking down in the form of truly enormous cats... The Speed that was being shown in the drydock in your ship Stats was in the wrong scale and gave numbers that were inaccurate.  This also caused the bonus given by your engine, displayed in kilometers-per-hour, to be wrong: an engine might say that it gave an extra 30km per hour, but give far far more than that in the Stats if you did the math to convert.  This has been fixed so that: 1) your Stats now show the correct Speed for Railjack's world scale, and, 2) your engines are rated in meters per second which matches up to the Stats.  While it may look like your ship's Speed stat in the drydock has gone down significantly, please try flying around in missions and see how your ship handles. This only fixes how the UI reports the numbers in your Stats. No change to how fast your ship actually moves is intended, and if your ship doesn't fly at the meters-per-second shown in the Stats then it should be carefully measured and reported as a bug.\nFixed the Railjack Forward Artillery not damaging Crewships past their engines. You should find that the Forward Artillery hits harder and your shot isn’t wasted on just destroying the Crewship engines! \nFixed Crewships not recovering after becoming disabled by your Railjack guns.\nFixed Railjack Host being able to use Navigation before the mission is complete and Clients inability to use Navigation at all when launched from the Dry Dock.\nFor clarification, the correct functionality is Host and Client can use Railjack Navigation after mission complete and neither can use Navigation before mission complete.\nFixed enemy Captains spawning in the “Asteroid Base Commander” POI and Commanders spawning in the \"Kill the Galleon Captain\" POI.\nFixed Galvarc Missile Launcher not functioning for Clients.\nFixed Fiery Phoenix not becoming disabled when Flux Energy reaches 0.\nFixed full ranked Flow Burn not being upgraded further when placed into a max rank Grid.\nFixed Battle Avionics remaining disabled for Clients after Railjack is repaired from Critical Breach.\nFixed Dome Charges being consumed when a Client enters the Forward Artillery, regardless of actually firing the BFG.\nFixed issue where Clients would see Forward Artillery reload multiple times while waiting for Host to put Dome Charges in the weapon.\nFixed Clients not seeing Shatter Burst Battle Avionic explosion FX.\nFixed Clients not seeing the missile created by Shatter Burst/Void Hole.\nFixed being left out in space if you were aboard a Crewship when it despawns due to mission completion. \nFixed cases of losing the Railjack Forge UI if you attempted to activate it while sliding.\nFixed Railjack Ammunition and supplies that were spent during a mission not saving at the end of mission.\nFixed losing custom Railjack Skin/Colors if a Host migration occurred and you were the last remaining player. \nFixed Railjack Avionic/Salvage pickups sometimes not showing distance markers.\nFixed the camera breaking when Warping to another player while in the Archwing Slingshot.\nFixed Tactical Menu Chase Camera to better reflect the view of the player’s camera.\nFixed Dry Dock creating a blocking volume in a room that is built below it.\nFixed issues with selecting Veil/Saturn Proxima nodes when using the controller.\nFixed cooldown bar on Railjack Ordnance burst-fire weapons emptying and not start filling until after the laser's done firing, instead of when you initially fire.\nFixed Railjack Tactical Avionics cooldown tooltip information not applying Intrinsic cooldown reductions from Tactical Response and Swift Tactics.\nFixed Void Cloak cooldown timer not updating when viewing in the Tactical Menu.\nFixed Upgraded Avionics not showing their proper description and stats, such as being Ranked vs Unranked.\nOptimizations for the Kuva Fortress tileset. This includes cleaning up wasteful materials, abusive lighting, volumetrics, overdrawn meshes and much more. More optimizations to come!\n \nMade micro-optimizations to a script used in Survival missions.\nImproved performance of the Railjack cannons.\nImproved performance when using the Imperator Vandal in Railjack.\nOptimized runtime lighting in an Earth cave tile.\nOptimized real time lighting in the Jupiter Gas City Index tileset.\nOptimized the Omni tool to fix a hitch when equipping it.\nMade micro-optimizations to a script used for controlling doors. \nMade some micro-optimizations to HUD performance, especially on Railjack.\nMade a micro-optimization to UI performance, including while piloting the Railjack.\nMade a micro-optimization Railjack POI once sub-objectives have been completed.\nMade a micro-optimization to a script that handles fire breaking out on a Railjack.\nMade a micro-optimization to Chroma's Effigy ability.\nMade a micro-optimization to a script used to animate the Dual Kamas.\nMelee Heavy Attacks are no longer able to be triggered by holding 'E', they again live exclusively on Alt-Fire.\nThe loss of Melee Combo Counter feedback due to spamming Melee drove the vast amounts of requests for Melee Heavy Attack to not be holding ‘E’. A toggle for Melee Heavy Attacks is not in the cards, thus Melee Heavy Attacks are now essentially brought back to its original mechanic of having to use Alt-Fire. \nNPCs now have about a second of delay before being able to perceive other players or NPCs that come out of invisibility, regardless of alert state. Previously, combat-state enemies would near instantly retarget in such cases. Seen in:\nRemoved Riven Mods from the Codex Mod section.\nThere were a few issues present here: 1) the Codex Mod section not display all of your Rivens Mods, and, 2) the Riven Mods that it did show would point their acquisition to Cephalon Simaris, which only applies to Companion Weapon Rivens. Considering the extensive amount of Rivens possible, this option in the Codex does not function properly, as it would need to look up unique information.\nAll Gas City, Sanctuary Onslaught, and Elite Sanctuary Onslaught Captura Scenes can now be sold for 3500 Credits for those that have duplicates!\nA fully charged throw of the Orvius will now activate its unique enemy suspension mechanic. \nRestored the original default Energy colors of the Limbo Limina Skin and Nekros Irkalla Skin to match its original artist intentions.\n",

  "changes": "Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.12:\nAs mentioned in 27.0.11, we wanted to implement a more token based system to obtain the Tenebrous Ephemera that we removed from the drop table.

Loot gathered when on-foot in a Point of Interest, Crewship, and from killing a Boarding Party are now shared between the whole squad, so you don’t individually need to go collect the loot if you’re busy Piloting, Engineering, etc!\nThis excludes Health, Ammo, and Energy pickups. Also, AFK players do not get the items shared and cannot pick them up later.\nMinor Breaches, Fires, and Electrical traps now restore Railjack Health once again when a Catastrophic Failure breach is active!\nThe Health return was removed in 27.0.10 due to being used to manipulate Railjack invulnerability.\nAdded tips to the \"Configure Railjack\" screen in the Dojo.

So you shouldn’t see anything change except that game runs a little faster!\nMade a micro-optimization to a common function used by Railjack game-code.\nMade a micro-optimization to numerous Railjack missions.\nMade a micro-optimization to Railjack lighting.\nMade some micro-optimizations to HUD marker performance, especially on Railjack.\nFixed a crash when the Host aborted from a completed Railjack mission.\nFixed a rare crash if you were connecting to a squad while another player was dealing damage with a Railjack weapon.\nFixed a crash when fighting Sentients in the Sentient Anomaly POI. \nMore fixes towards broken Dry Docks when some players have different progression into the Rising Tide quest.\nFixed cases of Turrets being inoperable if a Host migrates while they were operating it.\nFixed Client bodies disappearing, Railjack turning into just black walls, and more bad states if they were operating a Turret when the Host migrates.\nFixed Clients dying and being Revived when operating a Turret resulting in the Railjack disappearing.\nFixed Clients crashing if the Host migrated during a Critical Breach.\nFixes toward Railjack Fast Travel not working properly while operating a Turret.\nSome issues still persist that we are investigating! \nFixed Wing Turrets moving their positions each time a Client mounts them.\nFixed exiting the Railjack with Hildryn’s Balefire active defaulting you to Unarmed with no Arch-Gun.\nFixed weird camera rotations after launching out of the Archwing Slingshot.\nFixed the Quick Progress screen not being usable after the first node transition in Railjack.\nFixed Lavan Elemental Reduction Avionics gain nothing from being Upgraded to Rank 1 unless on an Upgraded Grid.\nFixed Sentient Cores displaying the wrong marker after being picked up.\nFixed a couple issues of hangar doors on the Missile Platform not opening for Clients.\nFixed a script error when an enemy Crewship deploys their healing bubble.\nFixed a script error in the Railjack UI.\nDefense Waves will now complete if NPCs are downed (but not dead), except for the final Wave, where all NPCs must be taken care of.\nRemoved the hit-scan tracers from Imperator Vandal as it's now a projectile weapon. \nOptimized server-side code for game log-in.\nOptimized enemy Enemy class hierarchy slightly.\nImproved robustness of a script interface to try to avoid scripts breaking if you switched to your Operator at the wrong time.\nMade some systemic optimizations to the script runtime.\nMade some micro-optimizations to the UI system.\nImproved error handling in cache optimizer (some errors like being out of space) would trigger silent abort; it should now properly send you to https://www.warframe.com/en/iofail as intended.\nUpdated the \"Boss Kills\" section of the Profile stats to include 5 years of game updates (untouched since Update 14!).\nNot only does this stat include the updated boss types it now includes special bosses like the Hemocyte and Razorback. There are a few known issues for some bosses that remain.\nHydroid, Limbo, Mesa, and Mirage ability videos have been added to their respective Arsenals!\nIncreased the scan projector FX when Conserving on the Orb Vallis to address colorblind difficulty.\nImproved code-generation for certain types of compiler optimizations.\nFixed a performance regression in some rare cases for Ryzen processors.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed inability to use any Piloting maneuvers due to left stick being bound to zoom, effectively ignoring callouts in Intrinsic details screen.\nFixed the Upgrade screen for Avionics in the Dry Dock missing button callouts for Upgrading when using a controller.\nFixed LTHUMB button worked to activate the Search box even when the picker wasn't visible in the Avionics screen.\nFixed the Left/Right bumpers not functioning in the Avionics Upgrade Screen.\nFixed the Sort menu not working in any of the Avionics screens.\nFixed becoming stuck in the Avionics screen and having to restart the game.\nFixed inability to exit the Avionic Grid Upgrade screen if you place your virtual cursor over a Grid.\nFixed several crashes and hangs on Windows 10 when an audio device is unplugged or changed.\nFixed a rare crash when using Profile > Log Out from the menu.\nFixes towards pathing issues with the Drone in the Plains of Eidolon. This also fixes a very specific spot where the Drone would regularly get stuck. As reported here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/es51n3/cmon_de_its_been_2_years_why_do_we_still_need_a/ \nMost noticeable in Plague Star at the moment, but still existed outside the Operation with Plains Bounties. We’ll continue to check up on this issue.\nFixed the Vengeful Charge Ephemera providing constant light source for Mirage's Eclipse, resulting in a cosmetic granting the light buff to remain 99% of the time.\nFixed Mission Time carrying over from time spent in Dojos or Relays.\nFixed Mission Time including the time spent in your Orbiter after aborting a mission prior.\nFixed your Kuva Lich having the default Excalibur Helmet on their shoulder if you killed the Kuva Larvling as a Client. \nFixed Tactical Reload, Lock and Load, and Eject Magazine Mods not functioning for Clients.\nFixed toggle sprint carrying over into Wukong’s Cloud Walker (normal hold sprint did not).\nFixed Ivara’s Navigator cast animation not being replicated between Host/Client, resulting in no sound or movement.\nFixed the Quellor Alt Fire being silent when it’s meant to be Alarming (as indicated in the Arsenal). \nFixed enemies being immune to Vauban’s Bastille if they were ragdolled out of it previously.\nFixed Excalibur’s Chromatic Blade elemental FX and statistics on Exalted Blade not updating after you change your Energy colour.

  "changes": "Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.11:\nJust like you and your buff New Year resolutions, we’re here with some of ours (although maybe not as buff as yours \nyou’re looking great we must say).\nIntroducing global buffs for all Reactor types found in the wild. Any existing gear you have will simply be adjusted for Avionics capacity, which will automatically be a buff in all cases (note: the Vidar III’s range has been compressed significantly from a 30 -100 range to the new 90 -100 range, but we will not give you lower adjustments if you had a Vidar III Reactor with Avionics capacity values in the 90 -100 range before this change).\nWith these changes, it’s important to note how we got from Point A to B. When initially setting up the Avionics values of these rewards, we did not forsee the depth of the frustration the ranges caused, but in hindsight we should have. Thanks to your feedback, we are able to confidently make broad and major buffs across the board.\nTEMPORARILY removed the Tenebrous Ephemera as a drop from Reinforced Sentient Containers aboard the Sentient Anomaly in Veil Proxima. The drop method is causing numerous issues in terms of connectivity stability and player frustration. We’re going to be changing the acquisition method that won’t involve a direct drop rate in a near future Hotfix/Update, and will instead be closer to a token system (complete X Anomaly missions to buy Ephemera from a vendor).\nThe Tenebrous Ephemera will be coming back as soon as possible in a better acquisition method\nAffinity gained from all Omni tool Repairs and Forge actions aboard the Railjack is now shared with the squad!\nPreviously, only the player who performed the Repair with the Omni tool/Forge action gained Affinity. Now, when any individual completes tasks with the Omni tool or Forge, the Affinity will be shared across all members. This is not restricted to those onboard the Railjack \nthose flying around in your Archwing or taking out Crewships will also benefit. The goal here is to have the efforts of one benefit all and ultimately help each other earn Intrinsics for shared activities that keep the Railjack afloat. \nWreckage limit has been changed to match the existing Riven method in terms of how the limit behaves to the player. Instead of Wreckage being auto-scrapped when over the limit, a prompt will appear upon returning to the Dry Dock that indicates the over limit Wreckage must be dealt with before you can start another Railjack mission.\nWreckage Repairs that are partially funded or waiting for completion (timer not expired yet) can now be cancelled! Resources funded will be returned and the Wreckage will remain in your Inventory to be Repaired or Scrapped later.\n \nKeep in mind this doesn’t change the 80% refund from Scrapping Repaired Wreckage.\nChanged base Avionics so they all have at least one rank to address difficulty knowing which ones you can scrap and which ones you can't, due to the ‘no ranks’ Avionics stacking with all other unrankeds:\nLavan Ablative Shell\nLavan Heat Sink\nLavan Last Stand\nLavan Thermatic\nLavan Phasic Weave\nLavan Predator\nLavan Winged Force\nLavan Winged Steel\nVidar Last Stand\nTo accomodate for the base Avionic change above, other Avionics have been changed: \nVidar Predator: Higher base stat and higher drain\nVidar Winged Steel: Lower drain\nVidar Winged Force: Lower drain\nNumerous UI changes in the name of organization and clarity have been made to the Railjack Research and Configure screens:\nAdded MK category tabs to the Railjack Research screen to better sort and display your growing Inventory of Research.\nAdded Categories, Search Bar, and Sort options to the Railjack Components and Armaments screens.\nAdded a ‘Show Equipped’ and ‘Show Ranked’ option in the Avionics Scrap screen.\nBattle and Tactical Avionic Grids now have Grid category icons to mark which is which.\nIn addition, when picking a Battle Grid, we now reinforce which Grid you are selecting/viewing Avionics for by showing the category name and icon.\nHull Breach that are active when the mission succeeds will be fixed automatically.\nThis addresses missions failing after having already succeeded the mission due to players unable to fix the Hull Breach in time.\nIncreased the Range of Winged Cyclone, Winged Force, Winged Steel, and Winged Storm to 1000m.\nThis also fixes these Archwing based Avionics for Railjack also affecting the Railjack itself.\nIncreased the mount animation speed for the Archwing Slingshot and Wing Turrets.\nToned down the FX for both the Particle Ram and Fiery Phoenix Battle Avionic when aboard the Railjack.\nThis change is being made due to plenty of feedback requesting less visibility-inhibiting FX. \nTo further increase the visibility when a Forge is available for use in the Railjack, the two screens and orange circle above, and activation button will glow when it’s ready and appear off then it’s busy. \n \nReduced the brightness of the Crewship healing bubble burst FX.\nChanged the Railjack entrance UI marker to use the same blue as the Railjack marker in-mission.\nRefining in the Forge Bay with a controller now requires you to click and hold X for 1 second instead of simply clicking X.\nThis addresses accidental Refining due to mashing X to open the Forge window.  \nThe ‘Open Squads’ line now appears at the bottom of the Star Chart Railjack node mission info popup for consistency.\nDepending on the node, it was previously buried in between the Requirements or Rewards lines.\nFixed not gaining Intrinsics after mission completion.\nAn example of this situation would be if the mission succeeded while a Boarding Party was still aboard, but not fully dealt with until after the mission success popup. \nFixed a case of loading a Railjack mission forever due to some players having different progression into the Rising Tide quest.\nFixed Clients being stuck in a permanent streaming tunnel if they were in Dojo and Host in Liset.\nFixed cases of exiting the Archwing Slingshot resulting in a black screen.\nFixed a crash that could occur in Railjack if you were inside an enemy Crewship when it's destroyed.\nFixed Flux Energy that was in the capacity provided by Hyperflux Avionic being lost between Railjack sessions.\nFixed the stat value of Flux Capacity on Reactors showing higher than actual stats.\nWe're using Round To value of 10 instead of 1, so some values were showing higher than they should be (37.x would show as 40).\nFixed Rhino’s Roar ability buffing Battle Avionics on the Railjack.\nWarframe abilities are not intended to increase the performance of the Railjack.\nFixed the Shatter Burst Battle Avionic not displaying damage numbers when it affects enemies.\nFixed being in Operator mode in

  "changes": "Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.10:\nWe bring you another Hotfix before the weekend arrives. The first Hotfix of 2020, 27.0.9, brought a slew of Railjack tailored Additions, Changes, and Fixes (among general ones as well), of which we have been reading your initial feedback. Railjack Resource balancing continues to be a hot topic of discussion in regards to the overall Railjack experience. More to come!\nPlayers will now have ~3 seconds of invulnerability when exiting the Railjack or a Point of Interest! \nThis window allows for a moment to escape from the incoming damage aimed close to your location so you don’t fall victim to a one-shot death.\nIncreased the refund from Scrapping repaired Wreckage to 80% from 50%.\nA welcomed increase from feedback that still maintains the risk vs reward of repairing Wreckage, hence why is it not a 100% return.\nRepairing a minor Railjack Breach/Fire/Electrical when a Catastrophic Failure breach is active will no longer give Health back to the Railjack.\nThis addresses numerous cases of Railjack invulnerability abuse by manipulating the Catastrophic Failure breach timer. We’re looking at other ways to allow Health on minor Breach repairs/fires/electrical during a Catastrophic Failure without opening the door to this misuse. \nWreckage capacity now appears in the equip screen for Components and Armaments, allowing you to see how many you currently own while Scrapping.\nDistance values on Railjack enemies will now be displayed once their name is visible.\nUpgraded art quality for certain Grineer Installations in Railjack missions.\nMade some micro-optimizations to the Railjack HUD.\nFixed inability to destroy enemy Crewships that have been hijacked.\nFixed the wide door in the Pulse Turbine not opening for Clients.\nFixed being placed outside of the Railjack level when loading into a Railjack mission from your Orbiter as the Operator.\nFixed control settings such as mouse sensitivity being set to non-Railjack settings when a Crewship is destroyed. \nThis was most noticeable when Piloting the Railjack during the Crewship explosion, as sensitivity would abruptly change until the Pilot seat was dismounted.\nFixed cases of Armament Wreckage unique stats not showing. This was due to the physical Armament not being equipped on the side of the Railjack, which then considered it not equipped.\nFixed Carcinnox Armaments displaying incorrect Falloff ranges in the Dry Dock stats.\nFixed the Munition Ammo count UI in the Railjack displaying 1 more capacity than you actually have (ie 30/31).\nFixed Railjack Forge not applying yield multipliers (Engineer Intrinsic bonus) to displayed craft amounts.\nFixes towards Ram Sleds occurring during a transition to the Dojo after completing a Railjack mission.\nFixed hazard markers (Fire, Electricity, Fast Travel) inside the Railjack appearing in the wrong locations when viewed in the Tactical Menu while on the Pilot seat or side Turrets.\nFixed missing Railjack enemy UI after exiting/returning/exiting the Railjack.\nFixed incorrect minimap overlay when failing a Railjack mission and returning to the Dojo.\nFixed Railjack enemies displaying a Rank of 00.\nFixed a crash while transitioning levels in the Railjack.\nFixed a script error that can occur when exiting the Archwing Slingshot after opening the pause menu, which caused a persistent black screen.\nSome camera issues still persist that we’re investigating.\nFixed some Mods displaying under the Items section on the End of Mission screen.\nFixed Reliquary Drive appearing to have the ‘vacant’ text even after completing the Key quest. \nFixed unlocalized Railjack recall text.\nThe Shedu Blueprint has been added to Cephalon Simaris’ Lost & Found Offerings (only after acquisition Quest completion). \nIncreased range that the Mine Osprey drops mines from. This combined with their behaviour bringing them close to the player meant the Ospreys would only usually get about one mine dropped before hovering harmlessly near the player.\nRemoved decimals in the Arsenal stats if damage Falloff range is 1000 or greater to fix numbers overlapping and appearing messy.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed Jackal and Razorback not correctly turning to face players sometimes when you get behind them.\nFixed Korrudo having inherited the Hirudo’s Health on Critical Hits mechanic.\nFixed the Redeemer weapon series appearing to deal 10x Damage than it actually was.\nThis affected Arsenal stats only, in missions it did the correct damage.\nMore fixes towards Wisp movement animations issues when equipped with the Atmos and Nunchaku.\nFixed incorrect Energy color for the Vengeful Shockwave Ephemera.\nFixed Ivara Prime’s Quiver ability not using her Artemis Bow Prime mesh. As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1160446-ivara-primes-1-doesnt-use-the-right-artemis-bow-texture/\nFixed the Paris Prime arrow using incorrect textures.\nFixed incorrect Energy color on the Hema muzzle flash light.\nFixed overly metallic reflections on the Kopesh Longsword Skin.\nFixed incorrect lightning textures on Volts. As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1160559-bad-lightning-still-not-fixed/\nFixed missing Channeling particle FX on the Targis Prime Armor (appears with x2 Combo Counter).\nFixed seeing a distorted flat circle on the Staticor explosion (and radiation areas).\nFixed incorrect Kubrow eye glow color when using the Metus Fur Pattern.\nFixed Eidolon Lures disappearing at certain camera angles.\nFixed MOA and Kavat Companion Emblems being equipped on the wrong side.\nFixed broken warp sounds in the Sentient tileset.\nFixed a script error related to Tusk Mortar Bombards crouching.\n",

  "changes": "Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.9:\nArmor value changes:\nFlak: 300 to 150\nElite Flak: 350 to 175\nTaktis: 250 to 125\nElite Taktis: 350 to 175\nCutter: 250 to 125\nElite Cutter: 300 to 150\nOutrider: 800 to 300\nElite Outrider: 800 to 400\nHealth value changes:\nFlak health: 250 to 375\nTaktis health: 200 to 300\nCutter health: 200 to 300\nOur intent is to make Railjack weapons more effective on their own. As such, Rhino’s Roar and Saryn’s Toxic Lash no longer unintentionally affect Railjack weapons, as per [DE]Marcus’ post here:\n\nElite Exo Taktis\nElite Kosma Cutter\nElite Gyre Cutter\nElite Exo Taktis\nElite Exo Flak\nElite Exo Cutter\nElite Exo Flak\nElite Exo Cutter\nElite Exo Flak \nAdding Void Hole to Elite Exo Flaks should make it significantly easier to acquire due to their spawn rates, but we will continue to watch all the drops in case they need further changes.\nElite Exo Cutter\nDecreased the effectiveness of the Particle proc but increased its Duration\nReduced to 7.5% damage bonus per hit, still stacks, and lasts 20 seconds. The exponential growth and short duration meant this was far more beneficial to rapid-fire guns than anything else.\nIncreased the effectiveness of the Incendiary proc but decreased its Duration\nDouble the damage per tick but half the duration; same total damage but in less time to feel more relevant.\nPulsar series\nIncreased base damage\nIncreased fall off range\nThese extremely precise weapons were having trouble competing with the other options available. Increased damage by about 10% and increased effective range should help give them a more viable role.\nPhotor series\nIncreased fall off range\nExtra range and these also benefit indirectly from the improvement to Incendiary status.\nCryophon series\nReduced damage and increased fall off range\nReducing the armor values of enemies made these capable of killing every enemy in a single hit, this brings them back in line with the intended time to kill. Please bear in mind we are actively watching player stats and collecting feedback, and are willing to iterate on balance. \nZetki House\nReduced Heat Accretion for all Zetki weapon variants apart from Cryophon\nThis house trades more heat for more damage, but it felt like they were TOO hot for the amount of extra damage you got.  Compared to the baseline weapons, Zetki now offers 50% more damage for double heat instead of quadruple heat.\nPermanent in-world markers have been added to Avionics and Salvage in Railjack when they drop.\nThis will allow you to always know what remains on the field of battle, and how to navigate accordingly. Adding awareness to the important loot has been a huge request, and this visibility increase should make sure no loot is left behind. Aside, we are reviewing ‘vacuum’ range. \nAsterite Resource pickups now reward 2x as much Asterite. \nAsterite costs for Wreckage were going a bit too slowly, so now you will earn it at twice the rate. \nYour Squad Overlay is now visible when in various Railjack modes (Pilot, Weapon, etc).\nThere’s been consistent expression that ‘seeing my Squad’s status’ is important. We have now ensured it’s visible when piloting / gunning / etc, and we have added some new iconography to show player states. \nAdded ‘Squad Status’ for Railjack Missions in the Squad Overlay. \nThese Icons show what your squadmates are doing, including: pilot, gunner, cannon, Omni Tool, Archwing, at a point of interest, engineering, fighting a boarding team, in slingshot, in Crewship, or just messing around on the Railjack doing nothing specific. \nIntrinsic points can no longer be gained once all available Intrinsics are maxed out. If you are already above the maximum, your additional points have not been lost. \nRailjack minimap is now always fully visible.\nBetter centered the Railjack Pilot HUD diamond. \nAdded new force feedback to all Weapons and Missile Launchers. \nOff-screen space enemy markers in Archwing now show awareness state fill.\nFixed some color and alpha settings on off-screen markers in Archwing for better visibility.\nIncreased brightness and thickness of enemy markers in Railjack. \nUpdated the Railjack name placement on all Skins to be better visible.\nSet the maximum length for Railjack Names to 50 characters \nin practice, this is almost an increase. The limit before was set by width along the available real estate. Now we have properly conforming names. . \nOptimized camera placements overall when customizing Railjack / viewing aspects. \nThe ‘Toggle Interior’ button now has a checkbox to indicate active state. \nRailjack Health and Shield now show when they are invulnerable (i.e after a Catastrophic Failure Breach). \nRemoved HUD markers from missiles launched by Seeker Volley battle avionic, which also fixed enemy HUD markers disappearing. \nThe player’s view of a Cloaked Railjack (using Void Cloak) is now a more obvious effect.\nRailjack name shows in ‘edit name’ input box.\nRailjack name shows in HUD instead of generic ‘Railjack’. \nCargo consoles now show a small effect when they are busy and unavailable to use. \nController ‘start’ button now closes tactical menu instead of opening top menu.\nSlightly zoomed out the tactical map when on the railjack, increased visibility of minimap features.\nSorting for Drain will now sort higher Drain to the top.\nAdded Wreckage count to equip screen.\nFixed Engines Colour customization not working properly. \nFixed an issue with Railjack stats appearing as the default one when pressing ESC on any part of Components menu.\nFixed missing sounds on a certain Archwing fly-in cinematic. \nFixed a script error in the Tactical Map. \nFixed erroneous ‘Stealth’ component from Railjack gun Huds. \nFixed Arrows for Railjack markers pointing the wrong way when you have a scaled HUD. \nFixed Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead spawning enemy ships inside Railjacks (lol). \nFixed an issue where using the Archwing Slingshot with Melee equipped causes issues. \nFixed an issue where you could use menus while in Archwing Slingshot. \nFixed the ‘Hijacked’ Grineer Crewship spawning inside geometry. \nFixed multiple [HC] tags appearing. \nFixed an issue where players entering Grineer Ramsleds could travel unknown places. \nFixed Ivara’s Zipline persisting when in Railjack Emplacements. \nFixed Railjack audio looping when in Landing Craft. \nFixed the Reliquary Void Branches not persisting. \nFixed Ballistic and Particle damage icons being swapped in-game. \nFixed Railjack Slingshot FX colour not updating properly. \nFixed Railjack Weaponry appearing at odd angles for Clients when dismounting. \nFixed Clients being permanently dead in Railjacks if they return to a Dojo in the ‘Revive’ screen. \nFixed Tactical views of players on Railjack Weaponry not working correctly. \nFixed overlapping music on mission complete. \nFixed being able to acquire Revolite by methods other than crafting / preparing Payloads.\nFixed Archwing death causing players to respawn at the beginning of the mission.\nFixed Omni tool equip animation causing loss of functionality when mounting emplacements/piloting.\nFixed Omni Tool having an ammo type (which didn’t actually interact with anything).\nFixed multiple crashes that could occur when loading into a mission as a client in a Landing Craft.   \nFixed Omni Tool showing level ‘0’.\nFixed being able to exit an emplacement without animations instantly by spamming esc multiple times.\nFixed railjack mission complete popup rendering behind the railjack HUD.\nFixed grineer Crewship console disabling the shield when exiting the hack without completing.\nFixed Crewship healing bubble not being seen or affected by clients.\nFixed Sigma Engines displaying incorrect stats.\nFixed some weapons showing incorrect icons.\nFixed railjack engineering 10 intrinsic not working for clients.\nFixed the repair drones not disappearing if someone else repairs the malfunction before the drones finish it.\nFixed drifting sound stopping properly when pilot leaves pilot seat during drifting.\nFixed bug where Intrinsics could be kept on mission abort, which was never intended.\nFixed Archwing bug that would cause Clients to be stuck with normal weapons if they slingshot into a non-Crewship enemy.\nOptimized Host-Migration speeds for Clients to be significantly faster. \nOptimized collision on Orokin Derelict Tentacles to better match current player movement skills. \nOptimized muzzle flash FX on the Zundi Pistol Skin\nCleaned up Sonicor light FX. \nTweaked Ivara Prime prowl effect to be less prominent while moving to reduce eye-strain based on feedback. \nDisable Y key triggering randomize appearance in arsenal to prevent accidental randomization\nThe Pennant has been removed from Conclave. \nRemoved redundant ‘Damage Blocked’ stat from Saryn’s Toxic Lash. \nRemoved a crate from extraction zone in Grineer Shipyard so it will stop taunting solo players who couldn’t get it.\nUpdated the background for Glyph dioramas in the market.\nAdded decos around Simaris targets so they are less likely to be mistaken for Thralls. \nOptimized Imperator projectiles to improve performance.\nOptimized performance in a section of the Kuva Fortress.\nShedu now uses its clip mesh when disarmed (the whole gun is too big!)\nAdded pickup text to Shedu and Euphona Prime.\nPrime Smite Infested and the Zylok are now tradeable. \nDisabled the new boss Health bar on Razorback because it was causing an issue. Razorback will now have it’s original Health bar.\nAdded long requested Wisp Walk, Run, and Sprint movement to Melee weapons, and fixed her movement when equipped with the Shedu.\n",

  "changes": "Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.5:\nDirac is one-size-fits-all resource for Railjack upgrading \nfrom Grid to Avionics. Wreckage can be scrapped for it, Avionics can be scrapped for it, and it can be found virtually everywhere in Railjack missions. Avionics are an important part of your Railjack customization and power experience, and are only found in a few places.\nFor this round of changes, we are doing the following:\nNext up on our list is Resources overall, universal Loot Pickup sharing, and more!\nCrewships now have their own unique enemy marker to differentiate them from all other fighters around!\nRemoved (for real this time) Credit Caches from the Railjack rewards, as the ‘bonus rewards’ still included Credits. \nElite Kosma Flaks will now only use their shield ability if facing their target.\nRemoved Resource collection sound for all items except: Carbides, Copernics, Cubic Diodes and Pustrels due to a constant stream of that specific sound because it happens for every single pickup. Sound is now reserved for important Forging Resources!\nFixed an exploit where Turret encounters would infinitely respawn despite not being intended to (nor Grineer having the means to generate infinite turrets, yet).\nFixed inability to complete a Railjack mission with a Pulse Turbine objective if a Host migration occurred, due to vulnerable radiators respawning and breaking the objective.\nFixes towards Clients taking a longer time than normal to load back into a Railjack mission after a Host migration has occurred. Clients will typically take longer than the Host to load back in, but hopefully this cuts down the load time a bit.\nFixed Armament Wreckage not showing their innate bonuses before and after Repair. The before Repair stats can be seen by selecting the Armament Wreckage and pressing TAB.\nFixed unequipping and equipping Railjack Components resulting in their upgrades stacking. \nFixed a potential script error with the Missile Platforms in Railjack missions. \nFixed a script error when using the Railjack Particle Ram.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed Octavia using the default songs for Clients.\nFixed Kubrow animations popping/jittering when returning to the Incubator after the menu is opened.\nFixes towards Syandana’s clipping through Excalibur Zato Skins body.\nFixed a script error when the Eidolon Teralyst screams.\nFixed a script error when casting numerous Archwing abilities.\nFixed a script error when casting numerous Warframe abilities.\n",

  "changes": "Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.4:\n\nPractice stealth as you track your prey, then strike with ruthless precision as Ivara Prime! No hunt is complete without the Baza Prime and Aksomati Prime!\nAs regal and lethal as a nighttime wood, this is the queen of the hunt in her ultimate form.\nThe Orokin-engineered definition of silent lethality.\nThe elegant Aksomati precisely refined to its ultimate manifestation.\nYou can find Ivara Prime, Baza Prime, and Aksomati Prime Relics in their classic spots (Void, Derelict, Defense, Survival, etc) with the addition of Railjack missions \nAll Credit Cache Rewards have been replaced with Relics! Check your in-game Codex for Relic drop locations.\n\nGet the newest Prime gear with Ivara Prime Access and Prime Accessories here: https://www.warframe.com/prime-access\nWith this Vaulting comes the shift of the following Syndicate Sacrifices:\nIf you already wield the power of these Primes or have their Relics in your Inventory, they will remain after the Vaulting.\n\nAdded Railjack Health perks for performing repairs on the Railjack:\n15% of max Health for Fire and Electricity Traps\n20% of max Health for Ruptures\n30% of max Health for Hull Breaches\nCurrently a Hull Breach Repair grants you 10 seconds of Railjack invulnerability. With the added Health perk for Hull Breaches, we’ve tweaked the Railjack Invulnerability time to grant a benefit to those with haste to compensate! Repairing a Hull Breach now grants Railjack invulnerability scaled to the amount of time left on the ‘Catastrophic Failure Imminent' timer. You can get anywhere from 5 \n15 seconds of Railjack invulnerability based on your Hull Breach Repair urgency.\nRemoved Credit Caches from the Railjack reward table! Relics have been added in Railjack missions to compensate for this.\nIncreased the cooldown of the Elite Kosma Flak's Shield ability and fixed the shield not actually blocking damage sometimes.\nAdjusted hit boxes on the Elite Kosma Flak for improved accuracy. \nAdjustments to the Archwing Cannon firing animation for a less janky launch.\nRemoved a certain floating prison found in Railjack missions due to numerous collision/sizing issues.

  "fixes": "\nEmpyrean has arrived \nyour journey with your Railjack has just begun.\nWe’re here to answer one simple question for you: “How do I play Empyrean?”\nIf you have completed the ‘RISING TIDE’ Quest, you are ready. If not \nsquad up with a Railjack-ready Tenno, or begin the Quest yourself.\nEarth Proxima, Saturn Proxima, and Veil Proxima are destinations your Railjack can access with this Update. Things get harder the further from Earth you stray \nprepare yourself and your squad. It will take time to master your Railjack.\nEmpyrean brings the foundations of a new progression system \nINTRINSICS, as well as completely new Avionics, Gear, and Resources for you to earn and find. You and your crew will need to stay together to stay alive.\nThis is the beginning of Empyrean. War is coming.\nIs your Crew ready?\nThe Warframe Team\nHello, and thank you for flying with Warframe Empyrean! The following notes are your go-to manual and guide towards the success of your own Railjack experience. We’ve split the Empyrean category of the notes into 2 main sections:\nFinished “RISING TIDE”? The time has come to breathe life into your dormant Railjack. Enter your Railjack and proceed to the Reliquary located in the aft. From there you’ll initiate a mission to seek the missing piece before you can Take Flight… good luck, Tenno.\n\nThe base MK of each COMPONENT, (Shield Array, Engine, Reactor) and ARMAMENT (Nose Turret, Wing Turrets, and Ordnance) are available to Research. Once you have fully Researched the base MK, the next MK is unlocked for Research (with MK 3 being the max).\n\nEach WRECKAGE part has its own unique set of stats that can be applied, such as Status Effects, increased Fire Rate, etc. If you decide this WRECKAGE part is not needed in your Inventory you can choose to SCRAP it in 2 different ways:\nYou can have a capacity max of 30 WRECKAGE in your Inventory. Any new WRECKAGE obtained will be automatically scrapped for Dirac, so managing your Inventory and Repairing when able is important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Intrinsic Point Spent earns you 1,500 Mastery. If you complete 10 ranks in a given Intrinsic, that will be 15,000 Mastery. Months from now, if you complete 10 ranks in every Intrinsic, that will be 60,000 Mastery!\n*When the COMMAND Intrinsic launches in 2020, we will also offer a chance to rebalance your Intrinsic skills, thus refunding you all your spent Intrinsics to edit your skills however you please with the addition of COMMAND.\n\n\n\nA new selection of missions in the PROXIMA regions of planets and space have appeared.\nIf you don’t have a Railjack or are wanting to join another crew, you can do so using the “Join a Crew” toggle in the Star Chart. If you want to use your own Railjack, you can “Form a Crew” and host the mission by starting it from Navigation in your Railjack.\nYou can enter your Railjack from the Dry Dock itself, via the Railjack express console at the back of your Orbiter (located just outside the Personal Quarters area), or by accessing the “Board Railjack” option in the Menu from your Orbiter (option to “Return to Orbiter” is also available while on the Railjack!).\n\nChange your Warframe's Loadout before taking flight by accessing the Arsenal located within your Railjack, across from the boarding port.  The Arsenal is disabled once you have taken off, so select the best gear for the mission before hand.\nSOVER STRAIT\nPOSIT CLUSTER \nMINHAST STATION \nPHANGHOUL SATELLITES\nIOTA TEMPLE \nJEX LANES\nOGAL CLUSTER\nKORMS BELT\nRIAN BELT\nBENDAR CLUSTER\nMORDO CLUSTER\nKASIO'S REST\nVILA GAP\nSPIRO GAP\nNODO GAP\nLUPAL PASS\nVAND CLUSTER\nRYA\nFLEXA\nGIAN POINT\nRUSE WAR FIELD\nNSU GRID\nGANALEN'S GRAVE\nH-2 CLOUD\nR-9 CLOUD\nThere are 3 Turrets aboard this Railjack. One in the pilot seat, and two on the port and starboard sides. Each Turret is also equipped with Ordnance for your destruction pleasures. The Railjack has 6 emergency exits that will eject you into space via your Archwing. Towards the top aft of the Railjack holds your Archwing Catapult that Gunnery Intrinsic Rank 3 will be able to access!\n\nThese Warframe Ability drops require Flux Energy at the cost of your Railjacks Flux Energy pool \nso use wisely! Those with a top tier Tactical Intrinsic rank will see reduced Flux Energy costs and reduced cooldown times.\nIf you fail to extinguish all the fires with haste, a Hull Breach will occur! Hull Breaches are represented in the minimap as red flame icons as opposed to normal fires which are orange. A Hull Breach is serious business, and Cy isn’t messing around when he says that critical failure is imminent. Once fires and Hull Breaches have been fully extinguished the Railjacks Health will be restored! If Hull Breaches are not extinguished within the given time on the UI, the mission will fail.\n\nAll Resources earned in Railjack missions that are not spent Forging will be awarded upon a successful End of Mission!\nIsos\nAucrux Capacitors\nGallos Rods\nKomms\nTrachons\nBracoid\nKesslers\nFresnels\nTitanium\nNullstones\nAsterite\nComponents and Armaments from The Old War exist as WRECKAGE in the Proxima regions. Find these and Repair them to use them! You can Repair these by contributing Resources, like in the Foundry but done in the Dry Dock, or instantly with a Repair Rush Drone.\nAVIONICS are your key to Upgrading your Railjack. Obtain these to increase your offensive, defense, and tactical prowess! These can be upgraded with DIRAC (below). Avionics drop from Railjack enemies in space \ndestroy them for your Avionics! \nOver 60 Avionics are out there \nfind them all, Tenno!\nIntroduced in Update 26: The Old Blood, bring 10 of these to Palladino for a Riven! Limited to 1 Riven per week.\nPlayers have often requested an alternate path to obtain Forma Blueprints. Forma Blueprints can be found within the rewards of Railjack!\nDirac is a powerful Resource that makes your Avionics and Railjack stronger. Use it to Upgrade your Railjack’s Grid and Avionics!\nThe deeper you venture into the unknown, the greater the quality of the reward!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed being able to start the Rising Tide quest before completing Second Dream if you set it as your active quest from the World State Window.\nFixed inability to Install Cephalon Cy in the Dry Dock after initiating the Rising Tide quest while in the Dojo.\nFixed a loss of functionality when attempting to modify your Parazon on another players Orbiter.\nFixed Kuva Lich having the attention span of a squirrel when surrounded by Nidus’ Maggots.\nFixed Kuva not appearing Taxed on the End Of Mission screen.\nFixed the World State Window's \"Next Objective\" panel directing players to the the Mars->Ceres Junction before Mars->Phobos Junction.\nFixed Grineer Guardsmen blocking 100% of damage.\nFixed enemies like Sentients being put into a ‘lifted status’ and playing wonky or popping animations because they weren't set up to ragdoll or rise from ragdoll.\nFixed Ancient Healer Specters not teleporting to players in Orb Vallis or Plains of Eidolon.

  "changes": "Rising Tide: Update 26.1:\n\nThe balance of power is tipping.  An imminent threat grows stronger, surging across the Origin System. Will you stand against it? Keep pace in the arms race by starting construction on your Clan’s Dry Dock!\nBuild the Dry Dock, assemble your Railjack and prepare for the coming battle. What will begin as a hangar will evolve into your sanctuary, a space to hone and upgrade your ship with powerful technology to become the weapon you’ll need. Build the Dry Dock by rallying your clan and contributing Resources to its construction. After that, if you have completed the Second Dream Quest, start the Rising Tide Quest to begin forging your Railjack.\n\n\nThe Grineer threat is mounting and you must rise to meet it. Track down the pieces of a long destroyed Railjack and breathe new life into it with the help of the newest Cephalon, Cy!\nTime has not been kind to the Railjacks. You’ll need to work with Cephalon Cy to find viable salvage from wreckage across the Origin System. After Cephalon Cy is installed in the Dry Dock, locate the six necessary Railjack components, retrieve them, then return back to the Dry Dock to restore them to glory. Once your Railjack is rebuilt, you’ll be able to board and explore your ship. Ignition and flight command requires additional components, which have yet to be located by Cephalon Cy.\nThis update previews new Resources for future update EMPYREAN! When Empyrean launches, a wide variety of Railjack Specific resources will launch in missions, but we are previewing 4 new Resources early to aid in the construction of your Railjack:\nEximus Units will Drop 2 of the new Resources:\nCubic Diodes = Eximus units on *Europa Ice Planet tileset\nCarbides = Eximus units on *Ceres Shipyard tileset\n*We've added clarification that the Shipyard tileset on Ceres and Europa Ice Planet tileset on Europa are the nodes that will yield these new Resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoubled the amount of Critical Chance on Melee Rivens and gave the Critical Chance 2x for Heavy Melee.\nAmalgam Ripkas changed to 187% Critical Chance (x2 for Heavy Attacks).\nTrue Punishment changed to 100% Additional Combo Count Chance, -50% Combo Duration.\nRank 1, 2, 3, and 4 Liches now drop Kuva for all squad members when a Parazon is used on them \nwhether that leads to defeat or ranking up, the Kuva is yours on Ranks 1 through 4! You will recall there was a brief window where Thralls could drop Kuva or a Requiem Relic. We removed the Kuva, and are now applying it to Liches. Kuva numbers are balanced against Siphons / Kuva Survival missions, and take into account the fact that multiple Liches spawn in missions. The aim is to not make this the best Kuva run, just an added value. Siphons and other missions are meant to be the optimal path. Rank 5 Liches do not have Kuva as a drop as they could intentionally be kept alive for a vector to acquire Kuva. The Drops are: Rank 1: 150, Rank 2:  200, Rank 3: 250, Rank 4: 300. This is lower than some other discussed numbers because we are now letting it share across Squadmates. \nLiches now run away (but don’t rank up) if you’ve downed them 3 times, but don’t use your Parazon on them. This allows you to overpower your Lich and have it flee, instead of having the only way to remove it from a Mission be your failure to know a Requiem.\n\nOperators can no longer perform Mercy kills on Larvling or Kuva Lich. Your Warframe is armed with the Parazon for a reason!\nMore fixes towards Requiem Mod UI lingering on the screen perpetually after failing to Parazon stab the Kuva Lich.\nFixed issue with Requiem Mod UI lingering and not updating properly after performing a Mercy on Kuva Lich as Wisp.\nFixed Kuva Lich despawning after getting downed while temporarily friendly from Revenant's Enthrall.\nFixed issues with the Vanquish / Convert context action appearing on Kuva Liches for Clients.\nFixed Kuva Lich weapons showing as fully Mastered in player Profile before hitting rank 40. Affected accounts should now see the corrected Mastered status based on progress.\nFixed Kuva Lich weapons not being localized in the End Of Mission results screen if you abort or look at last mission results.\nFixed Kuva Lich screen overlapping with the Market UI if the Market is opened while viewing said Kuva Lich screen.\nARCH LINE has replaced Itzal’s Blink ability:Launch a tethered hook that either pulls enemies close, or pulls the Warframe towards any stationary objects it hooks onto.\nImproved handling of alt-tab when fullscreen, particularly when using the experimental flip-mode optimizations. Please try it again if you had problems before! Please note that there are known issues with Experimental Optimized Flip-Mode when using on cloned displays.\nMade the optimized flip-model work if you booted up in native fullscreen before switching to borderless or windowed.\nImproved diagnostics for GPU-driver crashes (we now send you to the website for help).\nOptimized batch removal of friends to reduce server load.\nMade some micro-optimizations to screens with a button-bar.\nMade some micro-optimizations to the categorized grid UI.\nMade some micro-optimizations to the Mod and Upgrade screens.\nMade some micro-optimizations to certain UI scripts.\nMade some micro-optimizations to sorting Mods by \"recent\".\nAdded a projectile explosion range FX to Garuda’s Dread Mirror blood projectile for the local player (one doing the casting) so you can see your output.\nSlight trim to the Bloodletting cast animation.\nBloodletting now gives 35% Energy instead of 25%.\nReduced Seeking Talons charge time by around 15%.\nIncreased Seeking Talons Status Chance from 50 to 75%.\nFixed motion blur on Garuda's Dread Mirror.\nIncreased maximum Dojo Room capacity from 100 to 128 to accommodate for the new Crimson Branch and Dry Dock additions!\nAdded a new Captura Orbiter Scene so you can finally take a family photo with you and your 99 Domestik Drones \nnow with a new skylight!\nWe now allow the use of Skins on Zaws \nthis 2 year old request is finally seeing the light of day after some under-the-hood restructuring. If you come across any issues with Exodia, or odd behaviours, please let us know!

Previously, only Rescue/Survival missions on the Kuva Fortress were eligible due to other missions having an Archwing restriction; now the whole Fortress is eligible! \nA bug now turned feature; Ephemera’s obtained from a Kuva Lich can now be equipped on Sentinels and Companions! For FX sake, this will be a slightly subdued version of the selected Ephemera. Non-Lich Ephemera functionally is in the works! \nIncreased the chance of your Kuva Lich to have an Ephemera from 5% to 10%. Newly birthed Liches will have the 10% chance, while existing Liches will still be at 5%.

There are also two issues we are looking to solve in a calculated and better thought-out way to avoid the scenario we created yesterday with fixing a bug. The first issue is making the co-operative aspect of Lich hunting rewarding, and the second is treating the condition of downing your Lich (despite not having the right Requiems) have a different flow in a mission.  Thank you for your patience!",

These make hacking easier or give small benefits when hack is completed successfully!\nIntruder: + Additional Seconds to hacking. \nLive Wire: Shock Enemies within 24 meters while hacking.  \nAuto Breach: 30% Chance to autohack! \nRuntime: +45% Sprint Speed after hack.\nMaster Key: Unlock nearby lockers after hacking\nUntraceable: Become invisible for 18s after hacking. \nFailsafe: 50% Chance to retry a failed hack.\nASSASSIN MODS \nThese are for the new PARAZON ‘MERCY’ FINISHERS that can occur at anytime in game on eligible enemies.\nBlood for Life: 50% chance to create a Health Orb on Mercy.\nBlood for Energy: 50% chance to create an Energy Orb on Mercy.\nBlood for Ammo: Mercy refills magazine by 100%\nHit and Rune: On Mercy: +60% Parkour speed for 6 seconds\nOut Of Sight: Blind Enemies with 18 meters on ‘Mercy’ kill.\n\n\n\n\nNew Requiem Mods have arrived and they are the only way to end your Kuva Lich. Your Lich is immortal until you figure out the correct combination of Requiem Mods \nthe precise order matters, and the only way to glean the order is by seeking ‘Requiem Whispers’ from your Lich’s Thralls and trying them out on you Lich.\nThe 8 Requiem Mods are:\nLOHK\nFrom brooding gulfs are we beheld\nBy that which bears no name\n\nXATA\nIts heralds are the stars it fells\nThe sky and Earth aflame\n\nJAHU\nCorporeal laws are unwrit\nAs suns and love retreat\nVOME\nTo cosmic madness laws submit\nThough stalwart minds entreat\nRIS\nIn luminous space blackened stars\nThey gaze, accuse, deny\nFASS\nRoiling, moaning, this realm of ours\nIn madness lost shall die\nNETRA\nCarrion hordes trill their profane\nAccord with eldritch plans\nKHRA\nTo cosmic forms from tangent planes\nWe end as we began\nRequiem Relics also contain an all new item \na Riven Sliver! A fragment of a sundered Riven. It is known that, with enough Slivers, Palladino is capable of reforging a complete Riven.\n\n\nThe Void is reacting to the Lich experiments on the Kuva Fortress, and for the first time: Void Fissures are appearing on the Kuva Fortress! But these are unlike the others, and they only respond to REQUIEM RELICS.\nThere are 4 Requiem Relics \neach with 2 Requiem Mods.

Read on to learn how to do that.\n\nClearing Nodes and Killing Thralls leads to progression toward revealing your Lich’s 3 fatal Requiem Mods.\n\nOnce you know the 3 Mods, figuring out the Order is a matter of trial and error in battles against your Lich \ngood luck!\n\nYour Liches likelihood to hunt you down is indicated by a bar on your Lich menu. The angrier they are, the more likely to spawn. Once you’ve drawn your Lich out to fight by destroying their Thralls and Influence nodes, fights against your LICH can go one of two ways:\nDEFEAT\nif your Parazon does not have the proper order of Requiem Mods. You will be defeated, and your Lich escapes, and grows stronger.\nVICTORY \nif your Parazon does have the proper order of Requiem Mods. You will be victorious. \nTHE VICTORY!\nDefeating your Lich gives you two options:\nConverting your Lich with your Parazon corrupts it and turns it to your side, and will have a chance to appear in battle to aid you.\n\n\nWhen you Vanquish a Lich, you’ll get its Kuva Weapon variant that is completely unique to your Lich. The base weapons are as follows, with custom stats depending on your Lich:\n\n\nIf Kuva Weapons or Lifelong Companionship aren’t your thing, there’s more! The birth of a Kuva Lich from a Larvling has a chance to create a Lich with some added flair \none of Seven new Ephemeras that you can only earn from Vanquishing or Converting your Lich (if it has one equipped)! These are a bit more special and rare, so don’t expect every Lich to have one, but we will be balancing over time.\nBrand new Market items are available to help jump-start your Kuva world domination if that’s the road you wish to take.

Jumping slams Grendel into the ground and generates a damaging shockwave.\nGrendel can be earned for free through means based on the lore of his Leverian entry. Once you’ve listened, you’ll begin your hunt for Grendel by acquiring:\nGrendel Neuroptics Locator\nGrendel Chassis Locator\nGrendel Systems Locator\nThese Keys are found in Arbitrations and will expose hidden missions on the planet mentioned in his Leverian for you. Grendel helps those in need \nand only those who are truly ‘empty’ will earn his pieces, guaranteed.\n\nDinner is served. An iconic helm for Grendel.\n\n\nA most curious Syandana and one favored by the gallant gourmand, Grendel.\n\n\nTear and chew through enemies with this unusual crankshaft-style greatsword. Grendel's signature weapon.\n*When using Grendel with his signature Masseter, he will be immune from crowd-control procs while doing Heavy Attacks.\n\nIt's all you can eat with this collection for the gallant gourmand. Includes Grendel Warframe, Glutt Helm, Masseter Greatsword, Sumbha Syandana and 3-day Credit and Affinity boosters.\n\nNew Passive: Receive 5% Ability Strength for every enemy within a 50m engulfed in flame (up to a cap).\nWorks fundamentally the same as it does now \ntap for quick fire, hold to charge for greater impact. Enemies already inflicted by any Heat Status effect will now take additional damage.\nFireball has a casting combo, if you use it multiple times rapidly it gets stronger.\nThe damage output and charge speed also scale off of one of Ember’s newest abilities...\nTime for a history lesson! Prior to Update 11.5, Ember’s second ability used to be “Overheat”, offering an aura of heat damage which also protected her from enemy fire. Almost SIX years later, it’s time for this ring of fire to come full circle.\nWhen cast, Ember Immolates herself with protective fire armor. Her current level of self-Immolation is indicated by a unique UI indicator; the higher the heat, the more damage resistance, and the more effective Ember’s other abilities become.\nThe Immolation meter will build slowly at first \nusing Ember’s Fireball or Inferno causes the meter to build faster. But be warned! If the meter reaches maximum, Ember will “overheat” and Immolation will cost progressively more energy per second the longer you stay in an overheated state. To prevent this from happening, use Fire Blast to expel a portion of your heat meter, or toggle Immolation off to reset meter build.\nCasting time has been greatly reduced, and the ability now strips armor from nearby enemies. The amount of armor removed scales in effectiveness based on current Immolation levels. On cast, this immediately reduces your Immolation level by up to half.\nUpon casting Inferno, all enemies currently within sight are struck by a fiery comet, lighting each target ablaze in a personal ring of fire. Inferno costs Energy per each target in sight, with the cost capped at 10 targets, at which other enemies are then free.\nIf an enemy ignited by Inferno comes in contact with another unit, the fire will spread, igniting them as well with a fresh ability duration. Damage of the heat AoE scales with current Immolation level.\nWith these changes, players will take a more active role in “bringing the heat” to all that stand in their way, with added protection that encapsulates Ember’s volatile nature.\n\n\nWhen revisiting Vauban, we aimed to retain his status as a crowd control powerhouse, while increasing his mobility and lethality to keep up with 2019 Warframe’s lightning-quick pace.\nInstead of sticking to surfaces, these new Tesla Drones will roll around, following the player. Once an enemy comes within range, these Drones will latch on and emit a shock that stuns the target and nearby enemies. Each Drone has a limited number of shock charges before it must be replaced. Hold cast to summon multiple Tesla Nervoses at once!\nAll four of his mines have been replaced with new options:\nA deployable beacon marks a location on the map. After a short countdown, the area is struck by a massive orbital laser explosion (and yes, it does work indoors).\nVauban’s two marquee powers have been combined into a new and devastating ultimate ability!\nWhen deployed, a Bastille will capture nearby enemies, stripping them of their armor over time. Players standing within a Bastille’s radius will gain a temporary armor increase, building up over time based on how many targets are currently being held in the Bastille.\nWhen a Bastille’s duration expires, it collapses into a brief Vortex at the center of the cast for easy group kills. Want the Vortex to appear sooner, or last longer? Holding the cast key will collapse all active Bastilles early, or if you have no Bastilles, holding will deploy a new Vortex instead.\nOverall, many of Vauban’s powers have been streamlined or replaced, making his tools less redundant, and much more versatile for keeping up with the pace of an average Warframe mission.\n*Vauban and Ember have been removed from Conclave in the meantime for balancing.\n\n\nThe trappings of royalty. Includes the deluxe Titania Empress Skin, Hawkmoth Skin for the Dex Pixia exalted weapon, the Mot Skin for the Diwata sword, Titania’s Heartwood Armor Set and the Dendrite Gunblade Skin.\n\n\nContains Euphrates Pet Armor for both Kubrow and Kavat, modeled on the intimidating, bladed look of the Tigris Shotgun.\n\nIntroducing Vasca! A true child of the night, and a drinker of life.\nBring your Kavat to the Plains of Eidolon at night to meet a Vasca Kavat \nsnoot to snoot. If your Kavat becomes tainted by a Vasca bite, Imprint it and breed 2 together for your own bloodthirsty kitty.\nDon’t want your Kavat to carry the virus? Visit Master Teasonai in Cetus for the Vasca Curative.\nPLUS, new Vasca Floofs can be acquired by Master Teasonai!\nDon’t feel like getting in a cat fight? Check out the Market for the Vasca Kavat Starter Kit!\n\n\nIntroducing a new Exilus Weapon Adapter that unlocks an Exilus Weapon Mod Slot for your Primary and Secondary weapons, granting you extra capacity to equip utility Mods. You can find the Exilus Weapon Adapter as an Offering from the main 6 Syndicates, from the new Requiem Relics, or in the in-game Market!\nThese Adapters will be for Primary and Secondary weapons only. Once we have finished making changes to the Melee system, we will re-evaluate the need for a Melee variant.\nThe conversation of tight capacity already exists without the addition of the Exilus Weapon Mod Slot, so we’re making these Slots default Polarities, meaning all Exilus Weapon Mods are \n(Naramon) or V (Madurai) Polarity.\nIf you’re familiar with Exilus Mods, they are utility or movement Mods, not sustained DPS grants. Below is a list of eligible Exilus Weapon Mods that sustain the utility intention. Anything not included in this list was deemed DPS affecting and not true ‘Utility’:\nAmmo Drum\nShell Compression\nTrick Mag\nRifle Ammo Mutation\nPrimed Rifle Ammo Mutation\nShotgun Ammo Mutation\nPrimed Shotgun Ammo Mutation\nPistol Ammo Mutation\nPrimed Pistol Ammo Mutation\nArrow Mutation\nSniper Ammo Mutation\nVIGILANTE: Supplies\nEagle Eye\nBroad Eye\nOverview\nAir Recon\nAERO: Periphery\nAgile Aim\nSnap Shot\nSpry Sights\nGun Glide\nDouble-Barrel Drift\nStabilizer\nVile Precision\nStrafing Slide\nSteady Hands\nGuided Ordnance\nNarrow Barrel\nTargeting Subsystem\nHush\nSilent Battery\nSuppress\nSoft Hands\nTwitch\nReflex Draw\nLock and Load\nTactical Reload\nEject Magazine\nTerminal Velocity\nFatal Acceleration\nLethal Momentum\nAdhesive Blast\nCautious Shot\nFomorian Accelerant\nKinetic Ricochet\nTether Grenades\nAs a result, the following Mods have been tweaked:\nAmmo Drum increased to +90% Ammo\nShell Compression increased to +90% Ammo \nVile Precision is now -90% Recoil\nLock and Load from 13 to 9\nTactical Reload from 13 to 9\nEject Magazine from 13 to 9\nVile Precision from 11 to 9\nCautious Shot from 12 to 10\nRifle Ammo Mutation from 9 to 7\nPrimed Rifle Ammo Mutation from 14 to 10\nShotgun Ammo Mutation from 9 to 7\nPrimed Shotgun Ammo Mutation from 14 to 10\nArrow Mutation from 9 to 7\nPistol Ammo Mutation from 9 to 7\nPrimed Pistol Ammo Mutation from 14 to 10\nSniper Ammo Mutation from 9 to 7\n\nUpdate 26 brings change to Warframe \nit iterates on the game and Melee is no exception. For months Phase 1 has been in your hands, and it’s time for Phase 2. What follows is a detailed overview of our design direction and intentions with this new Phase.\nWe are not touching Melee Riven Dispositions until we get updated data \nexpect advance notice when we close in on a date for this.\nWe want you to know how your use of melee and feedback on the systems have helped form Phase 2, and how some changes are included to allow for a more cohesive Melee experience. Our tools made Spin attacks optimal at the cost of the more interesting Melee system, and we’re trying to rectify that overall.\nPreviously we made several changes to the Melee system (as detailed in the Melee Rework Phase 1 Dev Workshop thread) including:\nIntroducing a new quick-melee attack\nFull VFX overhaul on elemental damage types\nAimed Slam Attacks instead of impacting directly below an airborne player.\nWhile select changes are to be rolled back (yes \nsee below before you react), the rest of the system served as a good foundation for this much more expansive Phase 2.\nPlease bear in mind that these changes are not set in stone, and some aspects of the new Melee system will be tweaked during the usual QA process. There are some more features being added later on, introduced in Melee Rework Phase 3 at a later date.\nSo what is covered in Melee Update Phase 2?\nThe Return of Equipped Melee and Manual Blocking!\nDodge Cancelling and Tactical Dodging\n3.            Stance Changes, Combos and You!\n4.            Smoother Combo Transitions\n5.            Combo Counter Rework\n6.            Changes to Slam Attacks\n7.            Goodbye Channeling, Hello Heavy Attacks and Lifting!\n8.            Weapon Stats, Mastery Limits and General Melee Changes\n9.            Mod Rebalancing / Functionality\n10.          Exalted Weapons\n11.          The Screens: Arsenal Changes\n12.          Aim Assist\n13.          Sticky Fingers when Equipping Melee!\n14.          Channelling 2.0 AKA “Rage Mode” and Future Plans!\nAs you can probably tell, this section is going to be a bit of a lengthy one, so make sure you sit comfortably, drink a nice cup of Greedy Milk and get ready to read all about how you can better turn your enemies into salsa with your favorite melee weapon!\nAn overarching note before you get started, is that every Melee weapon that was originally a single Elemental damage type has been converted to Physical + Element, allowing for more Status reliability as well (Silva and Aegis excluded given Flame Blade).\n\nOne of the bigger changes added to the Melee Rework: Phase 1 was the addition of fluid swapping between melee and Primary / Secondary Weapons. However, some players preferred the ability to manually block, making some of their builds less easy to manage. While we restored manual blocking for players playing ‘sword alone’, it wasn’t quite the same.\nThe good news is that both functions are back! Holding the weapon swap button will equip melee fully again, and the aim button will manually block when in this mode. Holding the Weapon Swap button while Exalted Melee is in play will also lock you into Exalted Melee mode! (Don’t worry, Auto Blocking is still a thing!)\nWe also have redesigned the utility of blocking: Blocking will now prevent 100% of damage,  with a blocking angle that is dependent on the melee weapon equipped. All successful Blocks will also add to the new Combo Counter!\n\n\n\nIn the above example, sword and shield weapons (such as the Silva & Aegis) have a blocking angle of 70 degrees, centered on the front of the player, where as a dagger weapon (such as the Dark Dagger) will only have a blocking angle of 45 degrees. (Previously all weapons had a locked blocking angle of 45 degrees upon the introduction of Auto Blocking.)\n\nOne of the older and larger complaints of the melee combo system has been the animation locks. Completing 7 step combos feels great, but the animations completely lock you into the movements. We are introducing two new ways to put more control in your hands:\n\nBy far, the biggest change you will see in the new Melee system is the alterations made to Stances, as well how Combos interact with one another. In the old (current) system, Combos are an effect of button presses, all leading into a chain of animations. In Melee Rework Phase 2, attacks are buttery-smooth and adaptable!\nThis rework of Combos applies to every Stance, not just the weapon types. For example, Tempo Royale (a Heavy Weapon Stance Mod) will still have different Combos than the Cleaving Whirlwind Stance, even though both Stances fit the Heavy Weapon melee type. The difference now, is that both share a design that uses common movements and attack types.\nWe also wanted melee attacks to feel more intuitive. For example, if you are aiming down the sights of a primary weapon or blocking incoming fire, and then hit the melee button, you most likely want to get in close! If you are not inputting a movement key while meleeing, it’s usually a sign you want to finish off your target. We wanted the new Combos to reflect that that existing movement, and so the new inputs reflect that situational awareness.\nIn most cases, the following improvements can be applied to any given Stance Mod equipped to a weapon (not just individual weapon types!):\nAll of these fresh Stance changes has shone light on Whip Stances in particular not being as desirable in comparison to the others. We’re aware of this and are working on a new Whip Stance!\n\nIn the old system, only the first follow up attack inputted would remain in ‘memory’ and would execute at the end of the initial attack animation. Any kind of input entered after the initial follow up was ignored until the next attack had started. In the new system, the next attack is being constantly updated, depending on the last input received.\nThis allows for last-second decisions on combo changes to occur immediately after the first attack has finished. No more waiting for a combo attack animation to end before you can start spamming the attack button again! Embrace the fluidity!\n\nThe Combo Counter will be getting a new functionality pass. Rather than just providing flat bonuses to damage, the Combo Counter will now also act as an expendable resource for new heavy hitting combat: HEAVY ATTACKS! This will replace channeling's key binding, and Section 7 below covers those changes. This counter will be increased in a more granular and rapid way, and can be built by using melee attacks, blocking damage, radial damage from Slam Attacks and hits from a thrown weapon (such as the Glaive).\nAs an expendable resource the Combo Counter should be easy to replenish, and the changes made should reflect how easy you can acquire and spend the Combo Counter resource. In addition, the ‘heaviness’ of an attack will have a measured difference on the amount of Combo Counter it increases. As a general rule, lighter, swift attacks will give lower additions to the Combo Counter than slower, heavy attacks will. Swing for the fences, Tenno!\nCombo Duration is now displayed as a bar underneath your Combo Counter!\n\nThe ragdoll effect of the Slam Attack is being removed (with some weapon-specific exceptions *cough*JatKittag*cough*), however it is being replaced with an effect that will push enemies back or knock them down, giving the player some breathing room, and setting the enemy units up for follow-up attacks.\nMelee Rework: Phase 1 introduced the global use of ragdoll effects on Slam Attacks, so this is the second item to be rolled back, and replaced with a better way to rain down death from above!\nAlso, all Melee weapons have received an updated Slam FX \ncome on and SLAM (attack), and welcome to the jam!\n\nChanneling will be saying its final farewells in the Melee Rework: Phase 2 update, and instead is being replaced with a new form of Heavy Attack, as well as a new Lifted status effect. As we said before, Channeling Mods will also be changed to support this new system, as well as providing a larger pool of utility to choose from in your builds.\nThese are the changes planned:\nBut what about the Channeling FX you ask? Prime Armor Channeling FX will now appear when the Combo Counter reaches 2!\n\nWith this new change, there is a broad-sweeping review of Melee weapons and how they function with the new system:\n\nSince the base damage of melee is being buffed, some notable Mods are getting a balance and/or functionality pass. With the wide amount of changes happening to Channeling and Heavy Attacks, some Mods have had to be reworked into other systems or have had changes to the way their damage scales.\nFor full transparency, some of these are nerfs to specific Mods, but we felt these were necessary to truly allow Phase 2 to be treated as a new beginning for melee. Our intention is to create engaging melee and Modding variety, which is not possible when there is a one-best loadout or single Mod that can kill almost anything in the game. We love killing things effectively, but we also want the combat to be engaging and feel powerful. Spin attacks still exist, but the repetition of them is something we’re trying not to force you to use. To reiterate: select tools made Spin attacks optimal at the cost of the more interesting Melee system, and we’re trying to rectify that.\nAt the moment, the current list of Mods and their proposed changes are listed below.\nThis update will also see some changes to the following Weapon, Arcane and Focus School buffs:\nAgain, some of these changes are subject to review and change. Now that Melee Rework: Phase 2 has been rolled out, there will surely be additional balance passes as usability and effectiveness are used (or abused).\n\nAll melee-based Exalted Weapons have received the Phase 2 functionality treatment, gaining access to the combo changes. For those of you who may have missed it, Wukong’s Exalted Iron Staff has already had this functionality implemented (with the exception of the new Heavy Attacks and changes to the Slam Attacks).\n\nPart of Update 26 involves a change of the Arsenal Screen, and how information is displayed. In the current system, your Arsenal screen looks something like this:\n\n\nIn Update 26, this screen is being reorganized to include Loadouts, Companions and Vehicles in tabs, while also giving more information about a weapon when selected:\n\n\nAs you can see, new stats for Heavy Attacks and Heavy Slam have been added, with channeling statistics removed.\n\nAim assist can be a help or a hindrance depending on what type of attack you wish to perform. While the current system either applies to all or none (on or off), the new system will have more intelligence on aim assist on a per-attack basis. As a general rule under the new system, Aim Assist will be disabled for almost all attacks in the Forward and Tactical Forward Combos, and enabled for most of the Neutral and Tactical Neutral Combo attacks. Of course if you don’t wish to use aim assist at all, you can disable it from the settings menu as normal.\n\nAnother common issue in user feedback was the unequipping of Gear Items (like the Codex Scanner), or dropping the ‘football’ (usually a pickup for Mobile Defense or Sabotage Missions) when equipping melee or using a melee attack. This has now been changed so that you will no longer drop items or unequip Gear Items when either equipping melee or using a Melee Attack!\nThere has been a lot of discussion around this addition, and while it will not be included in the Phase 2 update, there is a lot of work being put into its application. This system is very special and we want to make sure that it is not just a cool addition, but that it has roots in Warframes lore, and a story behind it. This is something we want to implement with a lot of in-game fanfare and details will become available as progress is made.\nFor now, that’s it!\n\nSome time has passed since our recent Arbitration tweaks \nafter observing stats and listening to your feedback, here are our findings and plans going forward:\n-The initial purpose of the changes, rebalancing the different mission types, was a success! Vitus Essence output is now more consistent across the board when tracking earnings per mission type.\n-We heard your thoughts regarding the droptables, especially the points about Mod drops. We think there is value to having both purchasable offerings as well as luck-based drops, but we can see how these items “diluting” Endo drops would be a concern.\nWe are addressing this desire for more consistent Endo from two angles:\nDue to the addition of Vitus Essence dropping from Drones, overall Vitus earnings are..... higher than we anticipated. We've decided to leave these values as-is, but will be closely watching the impact Arbitrations has on Kuva economy overall.\n\n\nReduced the number of Kavor Defector squads required for a reward in Defection Arbitration missions to match other mission types.\nReward is now every 2 Defector squads instead of every 4 squads\nAdded a Vitus Essence Decoration to the Arbitration Honors Store.\nTweaked the Vitus pickup FX to be larger and red.\nFixed Vitus pickups sometimes falling through the floor.\nIf you’ve made it to this part of the Update notes, you’re well aware that a lot of the Warframe meta may shift in new directions. With the current path Catchmoon weapons are on, it was time to bring Catchmoon weapons to a more reasonable power level, while still keeping them effective.\nDecreased fall off damage from 100 to 10.\nDecreased range of projectile from 40m to 20m and fall off range from 20-30m to 8-16m.\nPlease note that we are monitoring item usage for other weapons who use similar projectiles (Fulmin / Arca Plasmor), but will provide notice before we consider changing anything. We are simply monitoring at this phase.\n\nHeat Status procs now reduce targets' armor to 50% of the original value, with subsequent Heat procs refreshing the duration. Not hot enough for you? Applying the Status proc multiple times also turns up the Heat, dealing more damage per tick as the flames increase.\n\nTitania can now Transfer to the Operator during Razorwing.\nTitania’s cast animations are now an upper body animation only (except Razorwing), alleviating momentum cancelling lower body animations and trimming cast time.\nThorns Tribute now has Damage reflected AND reduced to help our little bug feel a little less squishy.\nTitania can spawn up to four more Razorflies if all Tributes are active, one per Tribute.\nRazorflies can now pick up Tributes.\nEnemies directly affected by Titania’s Lantern will now have any damage they take dealt to them when the Ability ends (a la Mind Control).\nOur goal with changes to tonemapping is to alleviate fatiguing images by introducing darker midtones. Things may appear more washed out in contrast to how it was before, but don’t worry, it’s all intentional. If you spot things that are out of the ordinary and real wack, please let us know!\n\n\n\n\nThe Options screen, Ayatan Treasures screen, and Dojo Room Options UI have received a fresh new look!\nThe loading screen now puts your Liset at the forefront in a new formation!\nTekko Prime now gains additional Status Chance when used with Atlas and/or Atlas Prime.\nBase status = 10%, Prime = 26%\nEach Kavat can now give you 3 Imprints (up from 2). This will apply to all Kavats that predate this update. If you’ve already used 2, you'll find 1 more ready to go!\nYou can now enter your own Dojo from the Clan screen when visiting someone else's Dojo, instead of having to return to your Orbiter first.\nYou can now double-click on a Dojo Decoration to place it, rather than being required to select a Decoration and hit the Place Decoration button.\nIncreased volume of Lua Rescue Alarm as per player feedback.\nPressing ‘enter’ in the Loadout selection while using the search box will now equip the first Loadout in the resulting grid.\nIncreased the Exposing Harpoon duration from 10 seconds to 15 seconds.\nSwapped the Kuva Bombard Crimson Dervish and 80 Endo drop to Condition Overload.\nAllies will no longer attack Synthesis Targets, thus giving you full control on if you want to Scan.\nWeapon stats will now be reflected in a slightly more rounded way. Innate Damage is added before anything on the weapon happens \nboosting the weapons base Damage and then renormalizes the Damage percentages. This makes Elemental Mods stack in a way you would expect.\nMoved the ‘Tips’ section in the Arsenal Upgrade screens to the button bar at the bottom.\nIncreased the ‘Additional Item Drop Chance’ of certain Amalgam enemies from 2% to 4% due to discovery that this drop was broken (fixed below). Happy hunting! \nThe Riven Cycle screen now gives you the option to view the Riven stats on every owned variant of said weapon. For example, I can now select either my normal Lex or my Lex Prime to view it’s said Stats.\n\n",

Changed Energy per meter stat into Energy per second: unmodded Energy drain remains the same, and while speed Mods previously increased Energy drain (more distance covered), they now no longer do.

Currently, our statistics are looking at the effects of adding Vitus to Drones, reward balance between different mission types, and the overall reward output, comparing Arbitrations both before and after changes.

  "changes": "Arbitrations Revisited: Hotfix 25.7.6:\nLast week we released a Dev Workshop (link on those words: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1128051-arbitrations-revisited-part-2/) outlining our plans to improve Arbitrations, revisiting the droptables and improving reward frequency to be more consistent between modes. From new players who just completed the Star Chart, to veterans returning for new Arcanes and Aura mods, we hope these changes result in a more satisfying gameplay experience overall.\nAll changes are potentially subject to later changes based on feedback, so try out a few mission types and tell us your thoughts!\nIn the original Arbitrations, Excavation missions were the clear outlier in terms of reward output for time spent. The following changes are intended to bring all other missions to the same level as Excavation, and also iterate on other community feedback:\nArbitrations now use regular rotation length for their rewards, with the exception of Excavation. Excavation timers have been adjusted to compensate. Example:\nEX: In lieu of a reward every 10 waves of Defense, you will now receive a reward every 5 waves.\nArbitration rotation cadence has been changed from “ABCCCCC...” to “AABBCCCCC...”, so that the same level of time investment is encouraged.\nReduced Endo Rewards drop percentage in the drop tables. Rare non-endo reward drop rates are unchanged \nyou’ll just get twice as many chances!\nArbiter Drones will now have a small chance to drop Vitus Essence on kill.\nVitus Essence dropped by destroyed Arbitration drones will have the special pickup notification.\nGhoul Purge inbox messages will no longer automatically open your inbox or play the transmissions if you have completed all of the Encrypted Journal Fragments. \nTweaked weather patterns in the Plains of Eidolon to prevent lengthy rainy periods. \nIncreased brightness of Ash’s Bladestorm mark slightly to improve visibility.\nAlly NPCs will no longer attack Garuda’s Blood Atlar Victims.\nUpdated Umbral Forma’s description to properly reflect the items it can be installed on (Warframes and Melee Weapons). Removed the ability to use Umbral Forma on K-Drives and Archwing Melee.\nTweaks Ostron eyes to make them less glowy.\nLimited Shawzin to 30 notes per second to prevent macros playing ridiculous amounts of notes and causing issues. \nEnemies may now “react” (without changing their Alert state) to you by stopping and looking around if you shoot a Silent weapon within 2-3m of them several times quickly. \nApplying a Look Link to the same item (ex: a Nova Look Link applied to a Nova) that uses default colours will now properly apply the default color.

  "changes": "Wukong Prime: Hotfix 25.3.2:\nIf you're not an active participant in the Clan / Dojo system, a lot of this will go over your head. But if you've noticed a discrepancy in your Clan's Dojo XP since the release of Update 25, we have found the issue and have a full breakdown here.\nAll trophies are now exempt from Clan XP and will not reward it.\nThe Trading Post and Treasury will supply their intended XP.\nWe have a list of rooms and objects that grant you XP, but only if they exist within the Dojo (i.e cannot be built then destroyed). This now works properly + and we are working to highlight this fact more (as we work to expose in UI):\nRight clicking on Nightwave rewards will now display its preview diorama.\nFixed inability to mark Mods dropped from containers in the Void for the \"Mark a Resource or Mod\" Nightwave Act.\nFixed the Glaive Prime Blueprint help text saying it's obtainable from Nightwave Cred Offerings.\nWukong’s Celestial Twin no longer utilizes Quick Thinking to fix the Twin living indefinitely. \nFixed ability to replicate Wukong’s Celestial Twin multiple times by abusing Emotes.\nFixed Wukong’s Cloudwalk and Defy abilities turning off sprint toggle when used.\nFixed Wukong’s Immortality Passive triggering while in Archwing in Vallis / Plains which results in getting stuck in Archwing instead of being knocked out.\nFurther fixes to floating Armor on Wukong / Wukong Prime.\nHistorically the number of concurrent enemies in Survival was related to where the mission was in the Star Chart; early missions tended to have less enemies and later missions tended to have more and this number did not change even when you stayed in a mission longer to face higher-level enemies. As an experiment we have changed the scaling mechanic so that staying in a low-level mission longer will also increase the enemy count as it increases the enemy level until it hits the same cap it would have for high-level missions.\nIncreased visibility of the panic button placed at the Reactor console.\nReduced hack time for enemies at the Reactor panic button to 1.5 seconds.\nIncreased 'Defend' time to 60 seconds from 40 seconds.\nFixed no enemies spawning to trigger lockdown at the Reactor console.\nFixed enemies unable to reach the Reactor console.\nAdded objective text in the UI for maximum clarity for ‘what the hek is going on’.\nRemoved parkour tiles to reduce the chance newer players will get stuck here.\nPossible fix for Zanuka spawning in secret rooms and teleporting players there\nObjective UI markers now flash red to match red X attack markers.\nCorrupted Vor is now marked with a red X marker if killing him is required to progress past the 'kill enemies' stage in Interception.\nChanged Spy panic buttons in the entrance hallways of Spy Vaults to stop enemies using them and setting off the alarm when outside the vault in Gas City, Grineer Fortress, and Sealab tilesets.\nKuva Cell pickups now take priority over Life Support Tower activation actions to alleviate accidental Life Support activation in Kuva Survival.    \nIncreased brightness of the grey ABC markers in Lua Spy missions.\nImproved an extraction area in the Gas City tileset to be a little more generous.\nChanged the Venus Assassinate area marker so it matches the UI objective.\nRemoved ability to spawn Arlo Devoted Healers in the Simulacrum.\nRemoved Wisp footstep sounds when wall running.\nRemoved outstanding old Corpus Lockers and replaced them with the new Locker meshes.\nImprovements to the Gear Spiral controller sensitivity.\nMade Teleport Pits willing to send loot to a nearby spot as a last resort instead of letting it fall out of the world.\nMade hundreds of micro-optimizations to numerous game and UI scripts.\nMade some micro-optimizations to screenshots taken with F6 (particularly for 4K displays).\nOptimized game startup time slightly.\n",

With new energy requirements, the cast cost of Primal Fury was lowered but cast drain was increased to be turned off and on as desired.\nAnimation has been trimmed.\nThe range of Wukong’s Iron Staff is always long, comparable to top range Zaws, and no longer needs to build combo to scale range.\nPlease visit our Dev Workshop post to read more about the reasons for these changes:\n\nMade micro-optimizations to dozens of UI scripts.\nMade micro-optimization when handling loot that falls into teleport pits.\nImproved handling of corrupt cache and malfunctioning graphics drivers.\nImproved error handling for failures to teleport people out of pits.\nImproved handling of corrupt download caches.\nImproved handling of crashing graphics drivers.\nRefactored runaway loop detection for improved performance.\n",

  "changes": "Plains Of Eidolon Remaster: Update 24.8.0:\nOur goal with this update is to maintain the challenge that Arbitrations promised, while also ensuring that if you or a teammate is knocked out, they still have a chance to jump back into the fight! Iteration 1 brings the discussed Revival mechanic and enemy scaling changes to mirror normal Endless mission modes. We will be watching how these changes play out as we plan to iterate further on the mode in the future, with our next review for Arbitrations focusing on reward pacing.\nIn order to revive a player, 5 of these Resurgence Burdens must be taken to their tower simultaneously. These 5 pickups can be delivered by one or multiple squadmates, but cannot be “dropped off” at the tower \nit’s all or nothing!\nA similar Emote style to the TennoCon 2019 Emote, the Illumina Judicium displays your true dedication to Arbitrations with a looping Vitus Illumina Glyph whilst doing an angsty Meditation pose.\nAlso, a new Arbitrations reward has been added: the elusive Aura Forma Blueprint! Craft an Aura Forma to modify an Aura slot on a Warframe to be compatible with any Mod Polarity.\nRemoved custom enemy level scaling from Defense, Survival, Interception, Excavation, Defection, and Infested Salvage modes in Arbitrations. Enemy scaling now mirrors normal Endless missions that increase as the missions progresses. \nReduced Vitus Essence crafting cost for the Amber Star Blueprint from 2 to 1.\n",

Comical yes, but clearly an oversight of gravity!\nFixed the Melee combo menu not updating with the proper button inputs to use Melee when using a controller. \nFixed missing Melee Channeling binding callout in the Advanced Melee screen of the Codex when using a controller.\nFixed a number of Melee attacks that could leave weapon trails active after the attack is finished.\nFixed losing your crouch position when initiating a Melee to gun swap while crouching.\nHildryn can use her custom dodge while in Aegis Storm at the cost of her Shields (50). We're starting with this cost because many abilities of this nature have movement restrictions that can be overcome with Augments (Peacemaker, Resonating Quake, Assimilate). We want to try out a movement cost before we tweak further based on feedback. \nRemoved additional sound for Hildryn's Haven ability based on feedback.\nRemoved ability to access Gear/Emote/Hotkeys when Hildryn is in Aegis Storm due to it breaking functionality. \nFixed Clients seeing incorrect animation when observing a Host Hildryn in her Aegis Storm ability.\n1) We have Restored Arcanes not triggering from Exalted weapons across the board by reverting the change made in Update 24.4.0:\nDispatch Overdrive now applies to Garuda’s Talons when equipped.\nBalance is a conversation that we constantly have, and we see you having as well. For some people the answer is don't nerf things, buff everything else. This is the path of least resistance for us, as most of the player base is happy when we buff, and angry when we nerf. However this has a few side effects that impact the game as a whole. First, with more damage, the time to kill on enemies is lowered and the value of Crowd Control declines even more (Vauban?!). Higher max damage also means that players with the latest bells and whistles can easily kill bosses in an instant, and overcome any challenge with ease. The more your play, the easier the game gets!\nSo far we have been kicking the can down the road, accepting power creep and its consequences on the game \nand often this game is a 'kill all the things' based game. We've mostly done nerfs on things that could be automated, required no player interaction or removed options from the game by making all other choices bad. We will continue to wrestle with this, but the most important part is when and if we decide major balance changes are needed, we will let you know and it will be the result of a lot of consideration. Design changes like this need to be more tempered and considered.\nThanks for hanging in there through all this confusion. Six years in and we are still learning how to do this.\nK-Drive Race Standing has been doubled!\nStanding gained per Gate is now 200\nMax Standing gained per Race is now 6000\nCoolant Raknoids now pop their backs on death \ndelicious! \nThe Trading screen now contains a Riven category and specific search functionality!\nRemoved an unintended projectile launch on the 2nd charge attack of the Tatsu. This feature (as many have already determined) is unfinished, and will be revisited in the near future. Possibly tied to a certain Warframe...\nCorpus have improved their vent construction by removing momentum killing edges as reported here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/azz6m4/de_can_we_for_the_love_of_lotus_remove_those_tiny/\nReduced the frequency at which Nora Night’s daily transmissions play.\nWidened a damaged bunker opening in the Kuva Survival tileset. You know the one.\nSlight improvements towards hitches occurring when approaching Bases in Orb Vallis.\nCleaned up Gammacor and Staticor FX.\n",

  "changes": "Buried Debts: Hotfix 24.4.2:\nTenno, thank you kindly for your feedback, videos, and reactions so far on last night's Melee changes! We've been live for less than 24 hour with Phase 1 and we're going to start experimenting a little bit with some feedback. Our first experiment has to do with players who are truly committed to 'The Sword Alone'.\nManual blocking/parry has been added when players wield only a Melee weapon in a mission (i.e NO Secondary or Primary equipped). This is possible because in this specific state, the keybindings are free to allow this manual blocking. We do not plan on adding it to any other state yet. The default keybind for this is RMB/Right Mouse Button (LT for controller), as it was in the past.\nMelee Channeling can no longer be rebound on Controller due to it completely breaking Melee 2.99997 changes. We apologize for the discomfort this may cause for those who have built their controllers comfortably around a different binding. You can't make an omelette without cracking some eggs!\nFixed a widespread issue where players using Controllers could no longer Aim after the Melee 2.99997 changes. This affected numerous mechanics like Aim Gliding, Melee Channeling, etc.\nWe’ll be continuing to monitor controller issues as they arise! If you’re still having issues, restoring your Controller bindings to ‘Default’ will help in the meantime. Please let us know of further issues!\nFixed an issue where attempting to reload your Primary/Secondary while in Melee mode would not transition you back to your gun.\nRemoved Hildryn's Shield-gate mechanic that was applying to Eidolon Lures, resulting in an invulnerability for 3 seconds after their Shields are destroyed before becoming vulnerable again.\nFixes towards Teralyst (and possibly Gantulyst/Hydrolyst) getting stuck in the Plains which caused constant teleporting all over the landscape.\nFixes towards Teralyst (and possibly Gantulyst/Hydrolyst) not using abilities.\nHildryn's Main Blueprint has moved from Vox Solaris' Offering Rank of Shadow (Rank 5) to Agent (Rank 2).\nGreatly reduced the camera angle when casting Hildryn’s Haven.\nFixed Hildryn’s Shield Pillage not removing Status Effects for Clients.\nFixed Hildryn being able to use ziplines (and other context actions) while in Aegis Storm.\nFixed script errors when casting Hildryn’s Balefire.\nImprovements towards the Operator curly hair hairlines to show less scalp.\nBalanced the Jat Kittag spark FX for less visual noise.\nThe Rakta Dark Dagger’s innate upgrade on equip is now called Mind Haze.\n",
  "fixes": "Clarified and corrected the Buried Debts data-hashes section of the World State Window to read as ‘UNDISCOVERED’ when you haven't scanned any data-hashes yet, instead of ‘SCANNED’.\nUpdated the Diluted Thermia description to read:\nA magma like liquid that is diluted with coolant during the extraction process. Thermia can be found fracturing the surface of the Orb Vallis during thermal flare-ups. Could this be the key to weakening the Exploiter Orb's defenses?\nDiluted Thermia now displays as a special pickup in the UI (similar to Argon Crystal, etc).\nAmalgam Mods can now be Chat linked and found in the Codex.\nFixed a crash when engaging with a Thermia Fracture.\nFixed Coolant Canisters disappearing if you picked them up too quickly.\nHotdropped a fixed early this morning that was preventing players from downloading Warframe from the website. If you experienced this issue please try again!\nFixed real money purchased weapons (Prime Access, etc) not coming potatoed (Orokin Catalyst). Missing potatoes have been rectified to affected accounts in either your Inventory or the respective potatoless weapon depending on if you potatoed after the purchase was made.\nFixed inability to login when playing in Steam Big Picture mode.\nFixed cases of some enemies not attacking in Plains or Orb Vallis.\nFixed a crash that occurred when unzooming or switch weapons during Mining.\nFixed inability to Trade if it includes an Ayatan Star.\nFixed Exard Scaffold not resetting damage resistances on Sentients.\nFixed Harrow’s Penance recast not refreshing Duration.\nFixed Gara’s Splinter Storm self timer not being refreshed when affected by Mass Vitrify.\nFixed the Tarock Thrown Blade Skin not applying to the Spira Prime or Hikou Prime once thrown.\nFixed missing FX/texture for Rhino’s Iron Skin.\nFixed missing Elemental FX for the Glaive Prime.\nFixed Kitgun FX lingering perpetually if the Glaive is also equipped.\nFixed Warframe Ability videos turning white after unfocusing on the Ability.\nWe’re still seeing some playback issues with these that we’re investigating! \nFixed missing functionality when clicking an active Resource Booster in the UI.\nFixed Foundry UI notifications displaying a filepath.\nFixed [PH] context actions in the Mastery Rank 27 test.\nFixed a script error when accessing the Dojo Room Option Panel.\n",

A massive amount of fixes, changes, additions and more have been collected since our last Mainline (The Profit-Taker) and splayed below for you! Sometimes WIP features slip through the cracks and launch unbeknownst to us \nso if you see some weirdness please let me know!\nLaunching shortly after this Update is live is our first Operation of 2019. This entire Update is about 2.7 GB, get ready! What follows is a summary of the Operation post!\nThis Operation begins with a Community Goal \nthe hunt is on, Tenno. Can you unlock the secrets of the dead? If you've been paying attention to Devstreams, you may already know where to start looking...\nYou can receive Operation Specific Rewards by participating in parts of this event.\nThe first reward is more abstract \nyou can expand the Orb Vallis by solving a puzzle.... Together.\nThermia fractures are cracking open the surface of Venus, a consequence of Nef Anyo’s unrelenting greed. He’s willing to do whatever it takes for a quick profit, including putting the whole Orb Vallis at risk. By figuring out how to stop the Thermia fractures, you're able to earn these rewards:\nOperation Emblem\nAmalgam Mods x4\nOperation Sigil\nOpticor Vandal\nYou get 1 point for each Thermia Fracture you close \nif you close 4 Fractures with 1 Coolant canister, you get 3 bonus points (7 total)!\nAnd eventually, an incredible new boss fight will unlock where you can earn Hildryn! We are expecting this to take approximately a week with the estimated pacing of this Operation. Free players \nwe appreciate your patience, rest assured Hildryn is a completely free Warframe for you to earn as the Operation unfolds!\nGood luck, Tenno. You can all help each other if you know where to look.\n\n\n\n\nHildryn can be obtained via the Market, Little Duck Offering (Main BP), and as drops from a new Boss fight.\n\nHildryn Asuron Helmet can be acquired in the Market and in Nightwave’s next Series Offerings.\nSurator Syandana can be acquired in the Market.\nLarkspur can be acquired in the Market and in the Tenno Lab Clan Research.\nHildryn Collection can be acquired in the Market.\n\n\nQuaro Syandana can be acquired in the Market.\n\nLimbo Limina Collection can be acquired in the Market.\n\nTatsu can be acquired in the Market.\n\n\nTenno \nyour favorite melee weapon probably feels a little different today. Today we bring you Phase 1 of 2019’s melee upgrade \nwe hope you love all the gorgeous new visual effects, streamlined combat, and high fidelity hit reactions! Here's what you can expect:\nNo one knows the power of their Arsenal better than the Tenno \nyour adaptability and skill with the blade will be tested, and as we continue these changes, we rely on your feedback!\nIf you missed the full workshop discussing Phase 1, you can catch it here:\n\n\n\nGlaive slam range increased to 5m\nWarfan slam range increased to 5m\nDagger slam range increased to 5m\nDual dagger slam range increased to 6m\nClaw weapon slam range increased to 6m\nGunblade slam range increased to 5m\nNunchaku slam range increased to 6m\nSword and Shield slam range increased to 7m\nSingle Sword slam range increased to 7m\nBlade Whip slam range increased to 7m\nRapier slams increased to 6m\nDual Sword slam range increased to 8m\nTonfa slam range increased to 8m\nMachete slam range increased to 7m\nNikana slam range increased to 6m\nHammer slam range increased to 9m\nStaff slam range increased to 6m\nPolearm slam range adjusted to 7m\nScythe slam range increased to 8m\nHeavy Blade slam range increased to 8m\nFists weapon slam range increased to 8m\nSparring weapon slam range increased to 7m\nA full Visual FX pass has been done for Phase 1! Because this is Phase 1, it 'means all the unique weapons will have new generic FX for a little while (Jat Kittag etc.) until we can get through them all and make new clean variants'.\nNew and cleaner FX have been created with the idea of beautifully short, highly detailed lifespans. Not infinite \nmeaning the 'Constant Weapon Trail' option will be removed as a result of this change (at least for Phase 1, we really do think it looks better removed).\nBLOCKING\nBlocking with a melee weapon is no longer keybound, it is automatic when facing enemies who are dealing damage to you in melee mode. Your Reticle determines all!\nCHANNELING\nChanneling is now a toggle set to your alt-fire button when in melee mode.\nYour 'F' button (if using default key bindings) now exclusively swaps between Primary and Secondary weapons with a tap.\nYour left mouse button is gun fire, always, instantly.\nYour right mouse button is now aim, always, instantly.\nOPTIONS:\nWe are adding a toggle to preserve one aspect of the older melee system. You will be able to toggle an option, allowing you to continue melee attacks with the left mouse button once in melee mode.\nUpdated Reticles: Melee mode has received its own reticle!\nArchwing: Arch-Melee & Archgun now also use the 'instant swap' behaviour.\nDual Wield (i.e Glaive & Single Secondary) is still supported!\nExalted weapons will also benefit from the uninterrupted swaps! Be aware that Energy will still drain, even when swapping between weapons!\nAI hit reacts are getting updated! Enemies will have a more visceral/realistic response to the various hits you dish out.\nWith Melee Blocking now automatic, the Blocking angle has been reduced to 45 degrees.\nSigma & Octantis and Cobra & Crane Shield throw animations have been shortened and speed increased. \nIf using no custom Energy color, the weapon will inherit the colors of the Elemental FX (or base trails if no elements are present). This unifies all colors (swing FX, trails, hit FX, etc).\nRakta Dark Dagger’s equipped bonus is now an innate upgrade that triggers on equip and lasts for 30 secs (refreshed on Melee equip).\nVaykor Sydon’s Radial Blind now triggers upon toggling Melee Channel on/off if you have the required charges stored.\n\n\nIntroducing a new way to customize your Warframe: Ephemera! These new 'ATTACHMENTS' can only be earned and crafted by the brave. Once you acquire an Ephemera Blueprint and craft it, the ability to equip an Ephemera will appear in your Arsenal under Attachments!\nSeeding Step Ephemera (obtained from Arbitrations)\nFreezing Step Ephemera (obtained from New Boss Fight)\nShocking Step Ephemera (obtained from New Boss Fight)\nBlazing Step Ephemera (obtained from Elite Sanctuary Onslaught)\nBleeding Body Ephemera (obtained from Arbitration Honors)\nSmoking Body Ephemera (obtained from Stalker)\n\n3 new curly haired Operator Hairstyles are now available!

The Tenno have improved their hair care routine and it shows!\n\n\nCorpus inspired Highbrow, Two-Sloops, and Thugs Blueprints are available from Roky! Lord a tha board!\nBounties are now available out in the Plains of Eidolon! Certain tents placed throughout the Plains contain a console that encompasses the power to contact Konzu himself (when he’s not on his early lunch). \nWith Bounties now available out in the Plains, Incursions have been removed. These were meant to give players something optional to do as they spend their time in the Plains, but since Bounties can be activated on command, they no longer serve a purpose.\nPolished numerous Junction boss fights to have better power usage and combat pacing. \nRewrote Melee section of the “Training: Basics” Codex entry. \nRewrote Melee 2.0 section and renamed to “Advanced Melee” and moved to be beside \"Advanced Movement\".\nRemoved \"Dark Sectors\" section from the Training Codex.\nThe Warframe Abilities screen has received a visual and functional overhaul! \nAbility information is now displayed in a more condensed form, with hover-over functionality to display specific Stats and expand the information. \nA new ‘Tips’ section can be hover-overed to display tips for that respective Warframe’s Abilities such as tricks to synergize with other Warframes, most effective Damage output methods, Ability interactions within the Warframe it self, and more!\nRespective Ability videos now also appear upon hover-over to add that little extra spice! This initial Ability video aspect is currently functional for Excalibur, Mag, Volt, Garuda, Baruuk, Revenant, and Hildryn! More to gradually come!\nYour chosen UI Theme is now thematically reflected.\nThe Arcane Manager has received a visual overhaul to match the chosen UI Theme! Along with the new visual appeal, the Manager now also:\nLists which Arcanes you do not own (hovering over will display information)\nArcane Ranks displayed on the right-side are now selectable, allowing for a more direct Rank Up mechanic.\nThe Dojo Trading screen has received an overhaul!\n6 Trading Slots instead of 5! \nFaster item selection responsiveness and improved UI to help you easily find the items you want to Trade.\nRespective Warframe Ability stats can now be seen in the Warframe Arsenal Upgrade screen.\nThe Dojo Decoration screen and Dojo Room Construction screen now reflects your chosen UI Theme!\nHUD Damage Numbers and Affinity Numbers can now be separately toggled in the Interface Settings! \nRight clicking an Arcane in the Mod Upgrade screen now unequips it, similar to Mods.\nIf Coupons, Boosters, 2x Events, etc are active, hovering over the Icon in the top right will display a list of the respective active events.\nNumerous widespread changes to capitalized vs lowercase UI text.\nAdjusted the size and positioning of the generic notification popup.\nRemoved “.” period characters from names of Weapons and Pets.\nUpdated all mentions of Solar Map/Solar Chart to Star Chart.\nAdded checkmark to the ‘Ready to Trade’ UI screen.  \nImproved successful Mining discrepancies where it would appear you hit the perfect sweet spot in the heat gauge but were told otherwise.\nFixed stats when previewing Amp Parts while the Preview Gilded option is toggled appearing as Ungilded > Gilded. Now, it compares Gilded > Gilded with the new Amp Part.\nFixed UI lock after selecting ‘Replicate’ and then closing the Research screen in the Dojo.\nFixed certain Warframe Passive descriptions in the purchase screen and info popup not showing proper values.\nFixed UI breaking when sending someone a Gift and then traveling to Fortuna.\nFixed some UI Themes not maintaining respective text color.\nFixed Gear Spiral items displaying darker than expected when viewed in the Arsenal.\nFixed the Mining UI will disappear if killed while Mining.\nFixed Valkyr’s Warcry UI not reflecting the Eternal War Mods timer increase.\nIn Update 24.2, we included a number of changes to increase controller responsiveness. The initial changes caused the slightest changes in trigger pressure to interrupt firing and ADS \nwhich is being experienced predominantly with continuous fire weapons such as fully automatic and beam weapons (including Mining tools). This is due to a far too small trigger release threshold between firing and not firing.\nThis is, however, very effective with pistol weapons where a limited threshold allows for quick trigger taps.\nWith that said, this update is bringing the following changes to address the above:\nWe have increased the trigger release sensitivity so that there is more space for error between firing and release. This will help curb the muscle fatigue experienced with having to maintain constant pressure on the triggers as well as alleviate the accidental breaks in firing and aiming. This will require a bit more pressure to be released on the triggers before you will stop aiming and firing.\nWe increased trigger release sensitivity but maintained press sensitivity to strike balance between quick tap and continuous fire weapons. In other words, we have maintained the firing ease of Pistol weapons with quick trigger taps but have increased the freedom to apply various levels of pressure with continuous fire weapons.\nWhile this has felt much better overall in testing, we know that some may find that the increase still constraints gameplay in some form. More importantly, Tenno with disabilities may also find that this limits their ability to play. So we have also added 2 new sliders in Options > Controls to adjust trigger sensitivity to your liking:\n\nThe sliders will allow you to tailor exactly how much pressure you feel is most comfortable/close to your preference of play.\nThe homing energy projectiles that Enthrall pillars emit now have a chance to Enthrall enemies while inflicting damage if there is room in the Enthrall cap. This allows Enthrall to spread more organically, and as the cap is reached, damage continues on other targets. \nFixed Revenant becoming stuck in his spinning animations if he becomes downed during Danse Macabre. \nFixed Mesmer Skin consuming multiple charges when getting hit multiple times in the same frame from the same enemy (e.g. a projectile that hits you and explodes).\nLowered the Standing cost of the Tulok and Param Fishing Spears to 500 and made them available at Rank 0.\nImproved the visibility of the Color Pigment Research in the Clan Log by adding further detailed information as well as color coded texted to each respective Pigment.\nAssassinate encounters are no longer global, they are now localized to a specific area within a radius. \nThe encounter can be abandoned by leaving the radius.\nWe made this change because we received feedback that players are getting frustrated that they are so widely separated when trying to achieve the same goal in Bounties. \nChanged bonus objective of the Corpus Assassinate Bounty on Vallis: the Bounty will now fail if enough Credits are not gathered before the timer runs out, and Tenno will earn a bonus for collecting enough Credits within a shorter amount of time. This Bounty didn’t have a failstate like others, so we tweaked the objective and bonus objective for consistency. \nThe timer now scales based on how many players are in the squad. \nThe less players there are the more time is granted to complete.  \nAssassinate target now scales based on how many players are in the squad. \nChanged the cover evaluator for the Assassination targets in Orb Vallis Bounties so that they don’t run as far to find cover.\n\nOnce the 'mission complete' interval is met, players can head to extraction any time they choose (i.e 5 minutes for Survival). \nAny player at extraction triggers a countdown timer. \nIf all players leave the extraction zone, the countdown timer is cancelled.\nWhen the timer is up, the extraction ship arrives and any players in the extraction zone leave.\nAnyone still playing can extract later any time they choose.\nWe have made some much requested changes to the responsiveness of two things in Warframe: Weapon swapping and automatic doors. Right now in Warframe, if you are connected as a client you may have experienced delays in responsiveness of either of these essential things! The changes should result in a much smoother experience:\nSwapping weapons as a Client will now feel more responsive because we've made it Client-Authoritative.\nAutomatic Doors have been made Client-Authoritative. Previously there were cases of door not opening in tandem with the Host if any latency was experienced\nCameras now have a number indication to help differentiate them when viewing a large number of cameras together in one scene.\nVisualized cameras can now be selected by gazing at them in Free Cam Mode. \nEnabled pressing X to play the camera in Captura.\nMinor fixes for camera animation and post process lingering after Free Cam Mode is exited.\nFixed the Flox Syandana not unfolding its wings in the Arsenal and Captura.\nThe Navigation Window (where Alerts used to propagate) now displays more information about current activities such as the Plains Time of Day, Orb Vallis Temperature, Nightwave Acts, and more!\nOperator Void Dash no longer 'collides' with enemies if you didn't actually move with your Void Dash.\nCorinth Mastery Rank requirement reduced to 8 from 10.\nThe Chesa Kubrow Retrieve Precept has been changed to reflect the following mechanic:\nChesa Kubrow now attempts to retrieve the single closest loot, the same way Nekros’ Desecrate does.\nK-Drive races now award Affinity towards the actually K-Drive, not just Ventkid Standing!\nRemoved Synthula from Rotation A (Survival, Defense, Interception) rewards and made into a Clan Research Blueprint. \nIncreased Stim buff duration to NPC’s from 30 seconds to 120. \nChanged Burston building requirements to 600 Ferrite instead of 600 Nano Spores.\nExodia Contagion now requires you to be Aim Gliding to launch the Infested energy projectile.\nCleaned up grenade sounds across all enemies \nCorpus and Grineer now have unique grenade warning beeps and explosions!\nMagus Revert now has a 3 second cooldown. This cooldown is a result of macro abuse in conjunction with Magus Lockdown and Madurai Meteoric Dash in order to deal an absurd amount of damage all at once. This change also fixes the issue:\nFixed ability to Void Dash contentiously for no Energy cost when Magus Lockdown, Magus Revert, and Madurai Meteoric Dash are triggered.\nReflex Guard Mod has changed from 55% Auto Parry Chance to +100% Parry Angle.\nRenamed Limbo’s Haven Augment Mod to Rift Haven.\nImproved hand placement in the kneeling animation when logging into Warframe where chonkier Warframes appeared to have their hands clipping through their legs.\nSmall tweak towards the Corpus Sapping Osprey mine area-of-effect to better convey the hazardous radius.\nTweaked Corpus Ospreys movement to have more bodily rotation. \nNova’s Neutron Star Augment has been updated to reflect the following mechanic change:\nNull Stars (on recast) are shot to enemies within 30 meters (closer enemies prioritized), on contact they explode for the same area-of-effect they do today. If it can't find any enemies they explode like they do now.\nTweaked Vallis Terra enemy lasers to be thinner/fade near the end, and to be more freezing/snow looking versus electric.\nUpdated the firing FX of the Opticor.\nOptimizations for multi-core processing that were not possible with Windows XP.\nOptimized Orb Vallis level visibility and zoning.\nOptimized certain effects when hidden (such as the Edo Prime shoulder plate channelling electricity).\nMade some micro-optimizations to UI performance in Orbiter and on Pause screens.\nMade a micro-optimization to texture prioritization.\nMade some micro-optimizations to rendering.\nMade some micro-optimizations to GPU particles.\nMade numerous micro-optimizations to memory management.\nChanged Limbo’s Stasis to no longer affect temporarily friendly enemies (Nyx’s Mind Control, Revenant’s Enthrall). \nPolished the Exergis reload animation for smoothness.  \nIncreased the radius of the Profit-Takers final explosion \nyou betta run!\nAll Orbs in the Orb Vallis are now immune to the effects of Corrosive Projection.\nIf Alad V is killed before his taunt transmissions finish, the transmissions will now be cut off by his death cry.\nRe-enabled ability to equip multiple Echo-Lures to the Gear Wheel. This allows for quicker access to desired Echo-Lure when in that heated Conservation moment!\nShockwaves caused by Heavy Impact or Rhino’s Passive now use your Energy colour.\nChanged Garuda’s FX to green ooze and other particles for Tenno with Gore disabled.\nImproved the Corpus Dropship explosions on Vallis for an added razzle dazzle. \nIncreased the distance at which you can see Dropships warping in/out on the Plains of Eidolon. \nReduced volume of Archgun load and reload sounds.\nMelee combo damage multiplier now affects Baruuk Desert Wind waves.\nImproved mesh details on the Operator chair.\nUpdated Jackal's materials to PBR.\nImproved the camera shake on Baruuk’s Serene Storm ability.\nOptimized Landscape level visibility and zoning of Orb Vallis minimap. \nMade some micro-optimizations to the launcher's cache verification tools. \nMade a micro-optimization to memory garbage collection performance.\nMade some improvements to what Mods are prioritized when using auto install. \nImproved performance for Oberon’s Hallowed Eruption Augment.\nImproved performance for the enemy MOA leap ability in Orb Vallis. \nRemoved [PH] from Codex descriptions of Raknoid and Orb enemies.\nImproved sky fog in the Grineer Sealab tileset.\nImproved lighting & certain ramp sizes in the Grineer Sealab tileset.\nImproved environmental AI on the Grineer Sealab tileset. \nImprovements towards AI pathing in the Grineer Asteroid Defection tileset. \nWhen Titania is in Razorwing, melee strikes on the butterflies no longer cause screen shake. \nImproved Shield Lancer strafing movement. \nImproved AI jump actions in the Grineer Forest Defense tileset to alleviate getting stuck on their path to the Defense Target reported here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/auy1a2/the_enemies_ai_path_at_lith_defence_on_earth_is/\nTweaks to the Leech Osprey projectile mesh to fix it floating when stuck to the player.\nLowered Health of Grineer Arc Traps so they can be easily destroyed by a Melee radial slam.\nDispatch Overdrive now applies to Garuda’s Talons when equipped.\n",

The Archweapon Deployer can be obtained by completing the Orb Heist Phase 3 Bounty.\nAtmosphere Arch-Guns consume Ammo as opposed to unlimited Ammo/Battery in Archwing. Specifically new Heavy Ammo Drops which can be found from Corpus enemies in Orb Heist missions. Heavy Ammo Drops also reset the 10 minute cool-down when picked up, or replenish Ammo if needed.\nAtmosphere Arch-Gun can be summoned in normal missions with the Archweapon Deployer, but once Ammo has been depleted there is a 10 minute cool-down until you can summon again. The intent here is to allow you moments of beefy damage output, and not become just another Primary/Secondary weapon.\nDamage increased from 40 to 50.\nCritical Chance increased from 10% to 24%.\nStatus Chance increased from 5% to 12%.\nMagazine size decreased from 250 to 200.\nAmmo Capacity set at 400.\nReload speed set at 2 seconds.\nMastery Rank increased from 0 to 1.\nDamage increased from 35 to 40\nCritical Chance increased from 15% to 40%.\nCritical Damage increased from 2x to 2.6x.\nStatus Chance increased from 10% to 14%.\nAmmo Capacity set at 50.\nDamage fall off reduced from 100-350 to 60-120.\nReload speed set at 2 seconds.\nMastery Rank increased from 0 to 1.\nDamage increased from 60 to 110.\nCritical Chance increased from 25% to 28%.\nCritical damage increased from 2x to 2.2x.\nStatus Chance increased from 10% to 14%.\nAmmo Capacity set at 256.\nReload speed set at 1.4 seconds.\nMastery Rank increased from 0 to 2.\nDamage increased from 200 to 250.\nCritical Chance increased from 15% to 22%.\nStatus Chance increased from 10% to 16%.\nAmmo Capacity set at 80.\nReload speed set at 2 seconds.\nProjectile width decreased from 30m to 10m.\nMastery Rank from 0 to 3.\nDamage increased from 45 to 56.\nCritical Chance increased from 10% to 14%.\nStatus Chance increased from 25% to 30%.\nMagazine size decreased from 250 to 240.\nAmmo Capacity set at 480.\nReload speed set at 2 seconds.\nDamage reduced from 200 to 120.\nCritical Chance increased from 5% to 20%.\nCritical Damage increased from 2x to 2.2x.\nAmmo Capacity set at 240.\nReload speed set at 1.2 seconds.\nMastery Rank from 0 to 4.\nDamage increased from 275 to 310.\nMagazine size decreased from 60 to 30.\nAmmo Capacity set at 90.\nReload speed set at 2 seconds.\nMastery Rank from 0 to 4.\nDamage reduced from 1800 to 1200.\nCritical Chance increased from 25% to 30%.\nMagazine size decreased from 100 to 10.\nAmmo Capacity set at 30.\nReload speed set at 2 seconds.\nMastery Rank from 0 to 5.\nDamage increased from 40 to 50.\nCritical Chance increased from 10% to 28%.\nCritical damage increased from 2x to 2.4x.\nStatus Chance increased from 5% to 12%.\nAmmo Capacity set at 600.\nReload speed set at 2 seconds.\nChanged Fire Rate from 16.67 base ramping up from 13.33 to 25 Fire Rate over 30 rounds to: 25 base rate ramping up from 13.33 over 30 rounds.

Since her revisited kit depends on enemies effectively hitting each other, we changed the passive to make Nyx simply harder to hit.\nMind Control has a 4 second wind up at the start where incoming damage will cause the target's damage output to increase. The stronger your weaponry, the deadlier the output of your victim! \nReminder: All damage inflicted to the target will apply once Nyx deactivates Mind Control, or when the Duration runs out. \nBetter 'follow Nyx and attack enemies' AI pass.\nMind Control can now be cast while moving, and no longer halts Nyx in her tracks!\nThe cast time for Mind Control has been decreased, so you can better use the 4-second window to ‘power up’ your new minion!\nNyx’s passive ability to make enemies miss will be deactivated when she is using Absorb, meaning no shot will be wasted!\nNo longer deals any damage and will temporarily disable Armor & Shield, slow down Infested units, and disable Ancients' Auras.\nPsychic Bolts can be cast once on up to 6 targets. Kill these targets before you can cast again, OR hold '2' to reset targets and cast again!\nAbsorb damage type is now based on the damage types it absorbs.\nBaseline Energy Capacity increased to hit 225 at Max Rank.\nLantern can be cast up to 4 times at once (new targets replace old). Targets will gradually float back to their starting positions. You will be able to 'explode' all targets by holding the Lantern cast.\nRazorwing has a 'Vacuum' built in!\nVenus Shield Ospreys the spawn Nullifier bubbles only spawn if the Orb Vallis Alert level is 3+ and if the enemy level is 20+. \nLevel 2+ Alert level will spawn Shield Ospreys that don’t spawn Nullifier bubbles. \nA max of 2 Nullifier bubbles can be created per Drone.\nTotal active Nullifier bubbles (from all Drones) in the area will not exceed 4 \n10 bubbles (scaling with player count).\nQuick fire area-of-effect returned to 2m as intended.\nCharged fire projectile speed increased.\nMag size increased from 45 to 48.\nAmmo capacity increased from 270 to 288.\nClip size no longer affects charge time and is now set at 1 sec.\nCharged fire now deals self damage.\nReduced the shockwave distortion FX.\nChanged from semi auto to automatic.\nAdded a small amount of recoil for feedback when firing.\nnow has proper accuracy stats so mods will effect it\nFirestorm and Terminal Velocity Mods can now be equipped.\nReduced Aim Zoom from 2.23 to 1.6x.\nDamage-over-Time damage is now affected by +damage mods\nUpdated the overall FX.\nFire Rate increased from 2 to 3.\nAmmo capacity increased from 60 to 72.\nClip size decreased from 10 to 8.\nFire Rate increased from 2.67 to 3.33.\nAmmo capacity increased from  75 to 96.\nClip size increased from 15 to 16.\nCritical Chance increased from 5% to 14%.\nIncreased lock on angle of sticky beams from 15-30 to 40-60 (first number is angle it can obtain a lock, second number is when beam will lose it’s lock).\nIncreased Mag size from 40 to 60.\nIncreased Ammo capacity from 200 to 300.\nReduced the delay until you can use primary fire after using it's secondary fire.\nReduced aimed recoil.\nIncreased the recharge rate of Pax Charge when used with all Chambers apart from Catchmoon.\nPax Soar now also reduces the effect of gravity when firing a Kitgun.\nPax Bolt chance to activate increased from 50% to 100% at max rank.\nSplat Loader reload speed increased from 1.9 to 1.7 secs when used with Gaze Chamber.\nKillstream Loader status chance increased from 11 to 13% when used with Catchmoon Chamber.\nTombfinger Chamber area-of-effect damage origin now matches point of impact instead of behind it.\nOne major issue address is the fixing of an issue where almost 50% controller input was required before a hip-fire camera manipulation could be executed. We’ve decreased coded deadzones to allow for more refined, precise aiming and removed the inherited velocity when shifting directions. Players should now notice an immediate falloff in camera movement once input is no longer applied to the control sticks.\nAdditionally, we have added a number of mathematical improvements regarding the ramp and acceleration curves used to interpolate control stick input. This should make the camera manipulations feel much smoother and allow for a closer approximation of circular movement, compared to the very ‘square’ like motions we had previously.\nWe’ve also increased the amount of vertical movement seen when manipulating the control stick to reduce the amount of asymmetry between it and horizontal movement. There is still a bias towards the horizontal plane, but moving the camera up/down should not feel so drastically different when now compared to left/right movement.\nFixed Void Mode being toggled/stuck on sometimes due to interaction with the Power Menu on controllers.\nAnimal Pheromone Synthesizer items have been added to The Business’ Offerings! When deployed before using an Echo-Lure, these increase the chance of attracting a Rare variant of the respective animal. \nIncreased range of Tranq Rifle pulsing sound from 100m to 180m. \nFixed the UI breaking and Echo-Lure/Tranq/Mining Lasers not functioning after dismounting a K-Drive.\nFixed having no weapon when getting downed while the Echo-Lure or Tranq is equipped.\nFixed Tranqing an animal during its despawn animation would cause instant disappearance.\nFixed Echo-Lure’s not changing pitch for Clients.\nFixed a case of the Echo-Lure UI indicator not matching true pitch of the animal call.\nFixed Conservation UI (and other custom scopes) being disabled when dismounting a K-Drive.\nFixed potential cases of the Conservation start point or the call point spawning too far into the edge of the map, making it unreachable.\nFixed inability to use Warframe abilities after mounting a K-Drive with a Fishing Spear equipped.\nFixed rare case of Orb Vallis Servofish repeatable getting stuck in a specific spot.\nFixed Servofish frequently being worth 0.0 points.\nThe initial Trading Post screen and Research screen in the Dojo have been reworked to not only be more functional and aesthetically pleasing, but also to match your chosen UI Theme! \nResearch in progress now displays contribution progress in the right panel and incomplete material contributions will appear faded.\nHovering over non-Credit Research requirement materials now shows the item info as well as the amount owned.\nChanges:\nRemoved ‘-50% Magazine Capacity’ from the Precision Munitions Mod in Conclave.\n",

  "changes": "Fortuna: Update 24.0:\nIt's been one year since we added our first open world: The Plains of Eidolon. Our second world is ready: The Orb Vallis.\nEntering The Orb Vallis requires you to first visit Fortuna, a town full of new characters, new content, and new problems to solve! To do this, you must first reach Venus!\nReach Venus!? Our veteran Tenno have had Venus unlocked for years \nit's time to go back. Maybe you've played long enough to remember our first 'planet' procedural tileset on Venus and the excitement at the time.\nNew players might only be making their way there now, but with determination and cooperation, you'll master the challenges of the Orb Vallis in no time. We all lift together!\nEnjoy the efforts of all of us at Digital Extremes, delivered here in Fortuna. Your patience, support, excitement, and feedback has made this update possible. We dedicate it to you.\nStay warm on your K-Drives, Tenno!\nThe Orb Vallis landscape is so vast in size and discovery that even with the following 20+ pages of notes, this is just the first installment of Fortuna content! You can expect more to come in the next couple of weeks, including more Conservation species, new Operator Amps that will be available for sale from Little Duck’s offerings, and your chance to take down the ultimate threat roaming these terraformed lands. The long awaited Melee 3.0 will also be making its debut in full to accompany the Melee sound additions and changes that were released in Update 23.10.0. A Dev Workshop on the changes will be posted in the future.\nAs you take your first steps into Fortuna, meet with the Solaris and await the Corpus threats that linger above at the surface, the devs will be preparing to launch the second part of the Fortuna update.\nCompleting the Vox Solaris Quest will unlock the following Vendors in Fortuna:\nEudico \nBounties\nThe Business\nFishing & Conservation\nLegs \nMoa Companions\nVox Solaris \nRaknoid Hunting & Operator Agent\nRoky & Boon \nVentkids & K-Drives\nAxiditre \nNoctrul \nPhasmin\nTravoride \nGoblite\nVenerol\nHesperon \nAmarast\nZodian\nThyst\nSmokefinger also offers many other services such as purchasing Gems for Platinum, trading Gems for Solaris United Standing, and a lustrous list of Offerings available for purchase using Solaris United Standing:\n\nA new take on the Plains of Eidolon Fishing Mechanic!\nThe best way to catch the robotic 'Servofish' in The Orb Vallis is with The Business' offering of PULSE SPEARS \ntools used to disable mechanical fish! This new type of fishing spear maintains the high quality of every Servofish you catch.\nThe Business offers 2 variants of Pulse Spears:\n\n\nYour Ostron Spears will still work in The Orb Vallis, but the fish will be damaged. The key is to catch undamaged fish with the specialized Pulse Spears.\nThere are 13 species of Servofish to be discovered in the various Coolant areas of the Orb Vallis. Some require Baits \nbe sure to read descriptions to find your very own:\n\nEye-Eye\nScrubbers\nEchowinders\nMirewinders\nLongwinders\nSapcaddy\nBrickie\nTink\nKriller\nRecaster\nCharamote\nTromyzon\nSynathid\nBaits are used to attract certain species of Servofish.

Good luck catching them all!\n\nWhy Conserve?\nIn addition to rewarding Standing for each catch, you get treasured items for your efforts. Each animal you successfully conserve will yield you a Tag that can be exchanged for a treasured reminder of your efforts to help the wildlife. From 'Floofs' to a badge, find the offerings from The Business!\nThese Corpus-tech Modular Secondaries are crafted using a Chamber, Grip, and Loader. Blueprints for these components are purchased from Zuud using Solaris United Standing. Once crafted, Pistol Mods are the upgrades of choice in your Arsenal.\nZuud offers other services as well such as Gilding your Kitguns, exchanging a Max Rank or Gilded Kitgun for Solaris United Standing, and the ability to Entitle your Secondary Weapons for Platinum!\n\n\nZuud also offers enhancements for your Kitguns known as Pax Arcanes! Similar to Exodias for Zaw Melee weapons, these Arcanes can be installed on your Kitgun in your Arsenal once they have been Gilded:\n*final stats available in game\nOnce the Vox Solaris quest is complete, visit Legs to spend Solaris United Standing for Moa part Blueprints! Once you have a Model, Core, Gyro, and Brackets, you can assemble your Moa:\nLegs also offers new Robotics weapons that can be used by both Moas and Sentinels:\nCryotra: Emits a ray of sub-zero energy.\nTazicor: Burst rifle that fires electrified rounds.\nVulcax: Charges up a powerful blast of ultra-heated plasma.\nThe Emotion Module determines a Moa’s audio set and physical reactions to its environment. You can purchase an Emotion Module from the Market and equip it on your Moa the same way you equip Animation Sets on Warframes! Choose between Aggressive, Inquisitive, and Sensitive. Feel free to switch it up any time!\nLegs can Gild any Max Rank Moa to enhance its stats! Your Moa will also reward Mastery Experience once it has been Gilded.\nThe Moa head is the component that rewards Mastery Rank, because the head determines the Model. Gild all Moa Models to maximize your Mastery Experience with Legs!\nYou can also exchange any Max Rank or Gilded Moa for Solaris United Standing!\n\nYou can exchange Debt Tokens for Solaris United Standing. There are five variations of Debt Tokens:\nTraining Debt-Bond, Shelter Debt-Bond = Common\nMedical Debt-Bond, Advances Debt-Bond = Uncommon\nFamilial Debt-Bond = Rare\nEver a diverse broker, Ticker also trades repossessed items on the side.

Note that you will need to complete The Second Dream quest before you can be initiated into Vox Solaris.\nNeutral\nOperative\nUse your Standing to purchase the newest classes of Mechanical Operator Armour:\nHowzit, glinty? If you’re looking for a new way to traverse the Orb Vallis, the Ventkids have you covered.

You can exchange Ventkids Standing with her for K-Drive component blueprints, and she will even bash together a plank for you if you ask nicely.\nThese components do not offer any stat bonuses, but the Board will earn you Mastery when you rank up your K-Drive -\nno Gilding required! You can earn Affinity for your K-Drive by completing tricks in the Vallis.\nFor additional statistic or functionality boosts, Roky also offers a variety of Mods (in exchange for Ventkids Standing) for you to equip on your K-Drive in the Arsenal. Much like your Archwing, K-Drives can be customized in the new combined “Vehicles” (previously “Archwing”) mode in your Arsenal.\n\n*You can view final Mod stats by visiting Roky in the Clubhouse in Fortuna!\nChange the colors and choose your K-Drive Scrawl, featuring art from the Ventkids themselves, in the Customize menu. K-Drive Scrawls can be resized and re-oriented similar to Sigils, and can be found in bundles in the Market for Platinum!\nKubrodons Series 1 Scrawl\nKubrodons Series 2 Scrawl\nPobbers Series 1 Scrawl\nPobbers Series 2 Scrawl\nWhile you’re grinding your way through Orb Vallis, keep an eye out for Boon, the leader of the Kubrodon Ventkid Gang, who wants to see if your K-Drive skills are up to snuff. Look for Ventkids Icons on your minimap in the Vallis to find various K-Drive Race courses littered throughout the landscape.\nTalk to Boon at any of the icons to start a race. The rules are simple: pass through each of the checkpoints within the allotted time to complete the course. The real challenge is showing your K-Drive flair. The more tricks you complete during your race, the higher your overall Leaderboard Score and the more Standing you earn!\nFive K-Drive race courses will be available each day, but you can replay each race for additional Standing until you meet the Standing cap. For those looking for more passive Standing gain, you will earn extra Ventkids Standing for any tricks you complete in the Vallis upon returning to Fortuna.\nKeep an eye out for floating purple K-Drive Trick Boosters that appear while riding out on the Vallis: hit them for an instant boost to your trick score multiplier!\nAim + Direction + Jump = Small (tap) / Big (held) flip in that direction.\nAim + Direction + X  = Directional Dismounts.\nAim + Direction + Jump + Fire = Grab Flip in that direction\nAim + Direction + Crouch + Fire = Grab Grind\nCrouch + Direction + Jump = Air Spins\nYou can also grind on a variety of surfaces in Orb Vallis!\nOther commands:\nSprint is the boost key, to help you gain speed.\nJump can be tapped for a regular jump, or held to charge into a large jump to gain lots of air!\nThis is only a basic overview of the various K-Drive commands -\nbe sure to give them a whirl yourself to see what crazy combinations you can come up with.\n\nThe time cycle between these Temperatures is much shorter than the Day/Night equivalent on the Plains of Eidolon:\nWarm \napproximately 4 minutes\nCold \napproximately 22 minutes\n\nThe Corpus have also settled into this biodome and littered their own tech resources across the land to be discovered.\nMytocardia Spore\nGorgaricus Spore\nTepa Nodule\nThermal Sludge\n...and more!\nTo increase the Alert Level, simply allow the Corpus to summon more with active  'REINFORCEMENT BEACONS'!\nTo decrease it, destroy all REINFORCEMENT BEACONS and hide away out of combat.\nAs Garuda nears death, her damage increases.\nGaruda can be acquired via Orb Vallis Bounties & the Vox Solaris Quest, or in the Market for Platinum.\nFind the Bloodshed Sigil in the Market as part of the Garuda Bundle. You will be able to earn it free in a future Fortuna release \nevent style.\nFind the Nagantaka Blueprint in the Market.\n*Research for the Kreska, Ocucor, and Battacor can be found in the Dojo Energy Lab, or in the Market for Platinum.\n*final stats available in-game\nIn an effort to reduce the inventory duplication clutter that came with the individual Sentinel attack Precept Mods, Wyrm, Wyrm Prime, Carrier, Carrier Prime, Dethcube, Taxon, and the newest Oxylus now come with the “Assault Mode” Mod: “Sentinel will attack first visible enemy within an area” (*final stats available in game).\nIf you already own the original attack Mods they will remain in your inventory but cannot be equipped with Assault Mode. \nAssault Mode has replaced the original attack Mods on enemy drop tables. \nWe increased damage falloff range on the Sweeper Mod by 5m to allow it to work effectively with the Assault Mode Mod.\nPlease read our Developer Workshop for more information and direct your feedback/comments:\n\nSentinel weapon Rivens have been removed from the Riven generation pool. Those who own Sentinel weapon Rivens will still have them in their Inventories. Obtaining a Sentinel weapon Riven was simply lackluster compared to more applicable weapons.\nMining launched with Update 22: Plains of Eidolon and introduced a new resource extracting system to Warframe! Collecting Ore and Gems required you trace a pattern around a deposit using a Mining cutter tool in order to release it from its encasement. Since then it has seen several small iterations over time in order to ease what was at times tricky to execute, especially since the quality of the deposit was affected by the accuracy of the trace (which typically made the process very slow).\nWith the introduction of a brand new open landscape with deposits of its own, we knew that we needed to add new challenge that required similar levels of precision and skill, but in a speedier fashion and with much more return. So with that said, we have made the following changes to Mining:\nA thermometer gauge ring will appear with boxed indicators that denote where you have to land in order to extract from the deposit. Simply hold the fire button and release when you are inside any of the indicators on the ring. Red deposits still indicate Ores and Blue indicates Gems. Landing in the smaller of the indicators yields Gems (even on a Red deposit).\n\n\n\nAll hot spots must be completed in order to successfully collect Ore/Gems. \nHeat spots will glow red to indicate when you have successfully completed it.\nThe more heat spots, the harder the extractions become with timing pressures and moving boxes.  \nIf all of the indicators are missed, you will still be rewarded a small amount of Ore/Gem (depending on the deposit type).\nWe're back again with Operator Suit Changes! You may recall changes introduced in Update 23.10.0 shifted the mesh in several different pieces, including parts of the hood now being attached to the Torso. We did this because mixing and matching pieces is becoming the norm, and we want all Operator cosmetics to be compatible with this. However, the first pass lacked polish.\nChanges are now being implemented so that the hood mesh is no longer attached to the Chest piece of the Operator.\n\nThe Operator Waistband section now displays each Suit’s waist attachments with the proper highlighted cloth displaying in the Icon.

These choices will still respect the original chronological release, and by the next time you reach a given category, you'll see a new item appear in place of what you've already chosen (if applicable).\n1. Sigils and Resources. Days 50,150,250, etc.\n2. Primed Mods. Days 200,400,600, etc.\n3. Weapons. Days 100,300,500, etc.\nDay 1000 and beyond!\nStarting at Day 1050, Evergreen reward choices will be rotated every 50 Days though the following options:\nEvergreen Choices A (choose one):\n3 x Forma\n3 x Exilus Adapter\n4 x Weapon Slots\nEvergreen Choices B (choose one):\n50,000 Kuva\n7-day Boosters (Affinity, Credits, Resource)\n30,000 Endo\nEvergreen Choices C (choose one):\n3 x Rifle Riven\n3 x Melee Riven\n3 x Secondary Riven\nScaling Day-to-day: Scale all the things!\n     \nOne important thing to clarify is that the in-game items received on the non-Milestone Days in Daily Tribute system now scale based on the amount of days you have logged on. Endo is an example well documented in the past Workshop, but this also applies to Credits, Booster Durations, Resources, Syndicate Medallions, Relics, and Forma Blueprints.\nThe way this Scaling works is that we have chosen a base amount of a given item and applied a multiplier that reflects your current amount of Days logged in \nit does vary by item type!\nFor example, on Day 1 I get 1 x Tellurium, but on Day 1000 I get 6 x Tellurium!\nAdditional Information:\n\nThere is now a fixed Day 5 Reward of 25,000 Credits and 1000 Endo.\nOur goal is to make it only slightly more flexible while still respecting the core need to login frequently. Personalization is a huge part of Warframe and we think that this changes the Daily Tribute system to better reflect that. \nThe Lodestar Syandana and the Lodestar Armor Set \nthey are staying at Day 800 / 1000 respectively.\nWe have added custom lines and videos to each Daily Tribute which brings a Warframe NPC out to greet you on your new day.\nWe recently made the surprising discovery that Miasma’s damage multiplier for targets affected by Spores never actually worked. It has been fixed and will now work as we’ve intended it to originally. That said, seeing as it has been absent until now, we have increased the damage multiplier from 2x to 4x to encourage even more synergy between the two abilities.\nSeasoned Saryn players will notice the change immediately, as it can make quite an impact on the spread of Spores via Miasma kills. By increasing the damage multiplier we have reduced the following to compensate for the change:\nMiasma base Damage has been halved.\nSpores scaling damage per second cap has been reduced from 10 to 7.\nAs always, we watch for your feedback and encourage you thoroughly test out the changes first before leaving your thoughts. Thank you!\nAs we have added more complex Operator outfits and Armor Sets, we've made revisions to the some of the existing cosmetics to allow for better sharing of aesthetics among sets. There are now new seams on the shoulders, neck, and waist of multiple outfits which will make mix & matching less jarring!\nRevenant’s Reave wall width is now affected by Range Mods.\nRevenant’s Reave now also sheds Status Effects on cast and applies them to targets it hits.\nFixed Revenant's Thralls not granting Affinity when killed. \nFixed Revenant’s Danse Macabre being able to damage Nullifier bubbles (and then killing the Nullifier).\nFixed enemies affected by Revenant’s Enthrall and then a Radiation Status Effect being able to enthrall the Defense target, preventing the wave from ever ending.\nFixed Revenant Reave not using Modded Health/Shield steal values.\nFixed Revenant’s Reave Abilities page not properly showing the Modded Health/Shield steal values.\nFixed Revenant’s Thrall death pillars blocking projectiles.\nFixed various Syandana clipping issues with Revenant.\nPhantasma’s Alt Fire homing projectile amount is no longer based on charge time. Alt Fire now releases 5 total homing projectiles.\nPhantasma’s Alt Fire damage per projectile now scales based on charge time.\n\nOver 40 FX Decorations and 7 structural Decorations have been added for your decorating enjoyment!\nA brand new Sandbox room has been added! Check your Dojo Room Building options for the 'INSPIRATION HALL'!

  "changes": "We have a big batch of changes to Revenant based on constructive player feedback. Specifics per ability follow below, but a big thanks to everyone who took the time to login, play, and visit a space (forums or otherwise) to give their thoughts. It's crucial to the iteration process. Thank you!\nTHRALLS: We have made changes to have Thralls have more value in life AND death \njust as Revenant did. The general rule Thralls will follow is they provide CC in Life, Damage in Death. The goal is simply to have an easy supply of Thralls to make use of in both Life and Death.\nCurrently Enthrall has the following uses:\nWHILE ALIVE:\nYou can get up to 7 enemies Crowd Controlled \nthey won't attack you or allies and will draw Aggro from AI.\nIt spreads / is transferred \nthe Enthralled state is contagious!\nYou can Reave Thralls for greater scaling Health and Shield Leeching.\nIf Thralls are killed by Danse Macabre, overshield drops are created.\nAFTER DEATH:\nIt creates a damaging pillar, and that's it. Not useful enough in death at all!\nADDITIONAL After Death:\nWe've added the following with this update: \nWhile active, the pillar creates homing projectiles similar to the Vomvalyst attacks and Revenant's Signature weapon, the Phantasma!\nThe pillars can now be exploded to output their damage radially if hit by Danse Macabre.\nOn the development build before release, Mesmer Skin was recastable but we removed this due to balance concerns. But, our gut reaction was right and thanks to your feedback we've changed it back to how it was and you can now recast Mesmer Skin to recharge it!\nLowered Energy cost to 50.\nRevenant is now fully immune to damage while Reaving \nit's meant to be a life-saver! \nWhen Reaving Thralls with Mesmer Skin active, it restores a charge.\nWhen Reaving Allies with Mesmer Skin active, it adds the protective energy to your allies who happen to be in range. A small protective bonus!\nWhen REAVE is cast while in DANSE MACABRE, Energy cost lowered to 25. This allows for quicker, risk-free placement of Revenant for tactical maneuvering.\nThe Direction of Reave now follows last Reticle aim point which makes casting more responsive to intent.\nOxium Ospreys now appear within the first 5 Waves/Rounds of all Corpus Defense/Interception missions.\nSlightly increased the spawn chance of Oxium Ospreys in all Corpus Defense/Interception missions at higher Waves/Rounds.\nA ‘Founding Warlord’ Role has been added to the Clan hierarchy! This hierarchy is above ‘Warlord’ and there can only be one. Founding Warlord has all the permissions of a Warlord, but can also freely change the rank of any member. They also have the option of promoting any Warlord to Founding Warlord. This uses the new type of confirmation where you must type a keyword (in this case \"PROMOTE\") to go through with the change. The Founding Warlord now becomes visible to others and cannot leave the Clan unless they are the only member or promotes another Warlord to Founding Warlord. If a Founding Warlord wishes to be demoted, they must promote another Warlord, thus switching the Roles. If a Clan has a Founder already set (via Support), that person is automatically given the Founding Warlord Role (even if they weren't Warlord), otherwise the Warlord with oldest join date is made Founding Warlord.\nThis also alleviates a longstanding issue where the Founder of a Clan can leave, but they are still considered the Founder if they come back (and if they don't, the Clan has no member with Founder status).\nReworked the Vault contribution screen to reduce the number of steps you must take to contribute. You can also now browse the Resources and Decorations in the Vault! Previously you could only Donate and never knew what was already in there.\nRhino now has a HUD buff indicator for his Iron Skin!\nReduced numerous costs of required items for various quantity locked activities. Less grind more grofit:\nReduced the cost of Nav Coordinates required to craft the Mutalist Alad V Assassinate Key from 3 to 1.\nReduced the cost of Animo Beacons required to fight Ambulas on Pluto, Hades from 40 to 20.\nReduced the cost of Vestan Moss scans required to craft the Sunrise Apothic from 25 to 12. \nChanged Health Conversion to only remove stacks on Health damage. Previously it removed stacks on any damage, which was counterproductive when the damage was on Shields as they are not affected by Armor.\nThe emissive on Operator Facial Accessories is now controlled by suit Energy colour.\nIncreased the Anspatha Brace recharge from 30/s to 45/s.\nMade some micro-optimizations to AI path-finding.\nMade some micro-optimizations to some core math routines used by Visibility and Zoning.\nMade some micro-optimizations to Zoning code used by Sound Effects, Cameras, and Weather Effects.\nMade a micro-optimization to runtime object creation.\nMade a small optimization to the process of binding textures and samplers (dx11 only).\nReduced the smoothing window for the frame rate/time values. This may make things like Dynamic Vsync kick in a bit more promptly.\nImproved AI pathing in the Corpus Gas City tileset to reduce enemy crowding in certain areas.\nRemoved ability to unintentionally equip Hydraulic Crosshairs and Sharpened Bullets on Mesa’s Regulators. Although the buff appeared to trigger, it never actually applied due to the \"on aim\" criteria not being fulfilled (unless you had a very specific loadout with the Mesa Waltz Augment equipped).\nResource descriptions now indicate their \"Locations/where to find\" list to aid new players.\nRemoved special Warframe HUDs (Nidus, etc) from being displayed in the Dojo.\nReverted an unintentional reduction of Revenant’s max Energy. His max Energy is now as it was before 23.8.0.\nChanged Nezha’s Fire Walker to only ‘hop’ when cast while on the floor.\n",
  "fixes": "\n\n\n[DE]Pablo has been working hard on tweaks, with two primary goals in mind:\nMaking Nezha feel smoother and more fluid in gameplay\nIncreasing Nezha’s power overall by giving him added team support value and internal synergies\nWith that said, let’s break down the changes in order!\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\nIncreased max rank health from 225 to 375\nDecreased max rank shields from 225 to 150\nChanged from a channeling ability to duration-based.\nWhy? As a channeled ability, keeping Firewalker active would block all energy regeneration. Making the ability a single cast with a long moddable duration solves that problem, encouraging more frequent use.\nCast animation changed to a small hop that doesn’t restrict movement.\n\n\nCast animation has been sped up, and no longer restricts movement.\nEnemies hit by the disc are “marked” for a moddable duration, greatly increasing the damage they take from all sources. Marked enemies have a chance to drop energy orbs.\nWhy? Adds great team value to Nezha’s kit \nincreasing damage taken helps all allies, and energy orb drops enable frequent recasting.\n\nKilling enemies while they are marked will now produce healing orbs, instead of the current healing pulse.\nWhy? The current radial heal is invisible and very small, usually only benefitting players in melee range \nmost players don’t even know it’s there! Health orbs make the result more visible, while introducing other mod synergies.\nIncreased the number of targets the disc will try to hit before recalling, and improved some cases of faulty lock-on targeting.\nAdded a charged throw, causing the Chakram to fly straight forwards and backwards, dealing extra damage to enemies in its path.\nWhy? For a consistent flight path unaffected by lock-on targeting, use the new charged throw. Great for hallways!\n\nTeleporting will no longer cancel Fire Walker.\nHUD now shows a custom counter, indicating how much damage absorption is left, instead of a simple numeric percentage\n\nWarding Halo now only blocks 90% of damage taken. Will still block status effects and other procs.\nWhy? When considering Nezha’s revamped kit, he is excellent at mitigating enemy damage \nFirewalker and Divine Spears offer great area/crowd control, Blazing Chakram offers healing and self-sustain, and his outstanding movement can make the player a hard target to hit. In this context, Warding Halo’s 100% damage resistance was completely overshadowing his other options \nwhy heal or CC when I never take any damage?\nWith 90% damage resistance, Nezha is still very capable of tanking, but encouraged to rely on his other tools to avoid getting overwhelmed. Taking minimal health damage allows for synergy with Blazing Chakram’s health orbs, not to mention new modding avenues like Equilibrium, Health Conversion and various Arcanes. The change also allows us to improve survivability in other ways, such as the increased health pool, and major Warding Halo quality-of-life buffs listed below.\nDamage absorption invulnerability phase now begins as soon as you cast the ability. Cast animation also sped up.\n\nIncreased incoming damage multiplier during invulnerability. Damage absorption multiplier also now scales with power strength.\nWhen the health of the Warding Halo runs out, it will do an AoE heat status effect and give you a short period of invulnerability.\nWhy? This gives the player precious time to react, helping survivability while controlling the enemies immediately around you. Your next Warding Halo can be recast during this window to ensure you’re always protected!\n\n(Brief aside: as a Nezha main, I was originally skeptical of the 90% damage resistance change, and I suspect many readers will be skeptical too. However, playing the rework myself quickly changed my mind. The various buffs really outweigh the negatives, making Nezha much more capable in a supporting crowd-controller role. If you doubt just how potent 90% damage resistance can be, try out Gara’s Splinter Storm at 130% or more power strength!)\nSped up the casting/slamming animations, while removing the mandatory slam at the end of the Spears’ duration. (slam can still be triggered manually)\nHitting a speared enemy with Blazing Chakram produces a second Chakram, which fires at a nearby enemy.\n\nOn top of all that, Nezha’s sounds have been remastered, adding new auditory cues for important moments, like Blazing Chakrams returning to the player, or Warding Halos running out of health!\n\nSlight improvements to Blazing Chakram’s enemy tracking.\nPlayers will receive a HUD icon indicating the Health of a Safeguard Halo they received from Nezha.\nFixed Revenant’s Reave using the wrong value (Health) for Shield gain.\nFixed inability to damage Revenant’s Enthralled enemies with the Arca Plasmor.\nFixed Revenant’s Enthralled enemies still attempting to hack terminals during Interception missions. \nFixed Gara’s Mass Vitrify blocking Revenant’s Danse Macabre lasers.\nFixed Revenant’s Danse Macabre and Strangledome names being in ALL CAPS.\nFixed a progression stopper in the Sands of Inaros quest as a result of the first phase of the boss fight being skipped and Inaros becoming invulnerable. Also fixed the Tomb Protector in Sands of Inaros attacking while invisible and having floating weapons instead of being entombed while you fight the Golems.\nPotential fix for crashes when transitioning between Cetus and the Plains of Eidolon.\nFixed a crash that could occur if two people managed to tether themselves together (Nyx Chaos or Radiation Status Effect on two Grineer Scorpions, two M-W.A.M. Brokers in the Index, etc).\nFixes towards crashes caused by input repeating from held-down buttons (Spearfishing wheel, etc).\nFixed inability to equip Sinister Reach on the Phantasma.\nFixed ability to trigger Exodia Arcanes on Exalted Melee weapons. Exodia Arcanes still apply to Zaws, just not in Exalted Melee (Excalibur, Valkyr, etc) form.\nFixed being able to spawn more enemies/crash the game by spamming the 'Simulate' button in the Simulacrum.\nFixed ability to spawn an infinite amount of Corrupted Heavy Gunner Specters instead of the new Corrupted Heavy Gunner replacing the old one.\nFixed Transferring to Operator in a Void Fissure mission overwriting squadmates' Reactant counter UI.\nFixed the Anspatha Brace recharge rate not showing up in the Operator Arsenal stats.\nFixed issue where when Donating Decorations/Resources, it would also donate 1 Credit to Vault as well.\nFixed John Prodman spawning but is nowhere to be found in The Index.\nFixed Clients scanning their last Frame Fighter Fragment, getting the poster locally, but then losing it after a Host migration.\nIf you are in the affected pool please message http://support.warframe.com/ to get your Frame Fighter poster!\nFixed inability to see how many Stars are in your Ayatan Sculptures when trading them to another player. \nFixed accessing the Menu within the Ayatan Treasures screen resulting in the Menu being displaying in the background.\nFixed being able to use purchasable UI Themes that you did not purchase.\nFixed Warframe Ability banner showing when playing with controller even with the ‘Show Ability Banner On Cast’ setting is disabled.\nFixed the Zylok’s \"low clip\" sound from being audible everywhere.\nFixed voice sounds for Rana Del (Index).\nFixed Squad info panel displaying filepaths when accepting a Bounty.\nFixed blank characters in Set Mod descriptions. \nFixed broken code in text when Consigning a pet in Spanish.\nFixed Riven Challenge descriptions containing incorrect icons.\nFixed a script error when using Octavia’s Conductor Augment.\nFixed edge case script error that could occur if you received a game invite while loading into a mission.\nFixed script error in when joining a Dojo Duel if the Duel had been cancelled while the join was in-progress.\nFixed a crash when casting Rhino’s Roar ability.\nFixed a crash when casting and teleporting with Nezha’s Blazing Chakram ability.\nFixed a crash when casting Nezha’s Warding Halo ability.\nFixed a crash when loading into certain levels.\nFixed a crash when hijacking a Dargyn.\nFixed a possible crash when your Sentinel died.\nFixed a script error when trying to join a squad that had already disbanded.\nFixed Clients Transferring to Operator and back resulting in Revenant’s Mesmer Skin charge indicator being removed on the ability UI.\nFixed another crash from casting Nezha’s Warding Halo ability.\nFixed a crash when casting Nezha’s Divine Spears ability.\nFixed Revenant Reave being capable of flying.\n",

  "changes": "The Sacrifice: Update 23:\nWho would have thought that we’d be launching our third cinematic quest. With the ambitious goal of telling Warframe’s story in a way we had never done before, The Second Dream started it all. The moments you shared with us while playing through the quest is a memory all of us at Digital Extremes will never forget. So we thought… wow, we did it… Can we do it again? And so it was, we burned heaps of midnight oil to launch The War Within and experience the roller coaster of feels with you all over again.\nWitnessing your reaction to THE SACRIFICE teaser we showed at TennoCon last year is an emotion we can’t quite put into words. We’re pretty sure you guys shook the convention center and the internet. So we’re absolutely ecstatic that you can now continue your journey as Tenno in the Warframe universe in this new quest.\nFrom all of us at Digital Extremes, thank you for sharing Warframe with us. This once small but growing studio in London, Ontario couldn’t have done any of this without your extraordinary support, Tenno.\nWe hope that you have enjoyed the ride so far. We look forward to seeing what Warframe has in store for all of us as we look toward the future.\nThe Apostasy Prologue left a memento from the Lotus lingering in the Orbiter, calling back to the moment Ballas extended his hand to her. As they faded beyond grasp, nothing but fragmented transmissions from her remained.\nNow, a foreboding vision leads the Tenno to hunt for a savage Warframe. Will you unmask the truth in this mind-bending new chapter of the cinematic storyline? THE SACRIFICE will bring you closer to uncovering what has fallen into shadow.\nTHE SACRIFICE Quest is available after completing The Second Dream, The War Within, Chains of Harrow and the Apostasy Prologue, and will be available in your Codex upon login. Bring your best Warframe and Operator loadouts to face the challenges that await you in THE SACRIFICE .\n\nCurrently, we have exactly 131 screens in Warframe that need an artistic pass to the new style. 8 are done and ready to go \nthey're here today! Themes similar to above are coming for the screens we have completed, and all subsequent screens will inherit whatever UI theme you've chosen (default or other purchased themes).\nWe have also have 2 free Themes specifically tailored for our visually impaired and color blind Tenno: the “Equinox Theme” (B&W theme) and the “High Contrast Theme”! We’d love to get your feedback on them so that we can increase Warframe’s accessibility:\n\nTo change your UI theme, go to your Interface Options and select “UI Customization”.\n\nThere you can also change your Background from the 3 available options:\nEquinox Background\nLegacy Background\nVitruvian Background\nYou can also change the UI sounds from the “Legacy” and “Vitruvian” options.\nPlease see our Developer Workshop for more information:\n\n\nWarframes with unique Ability-driven (Exalted) Weapons can now be separately Modded in your Arsenal! This includes the ability to customize their appearance too!\nExcalibur/Prime’s Exalted Blade \nWe gave the Blade a partial physical design (hilt) so that you can customize its appearance (Energy color is still determined by Excalibur’s)! \nIvara’s Artemis Bow \nMesa’s Regulators \nIf you own or purchase the Mesa Presidio Skin, you will automatically receive the  Presidio Regulators skin to equip onto Mesa’s Regulators.\nTitania’s Dex Pixia + Diwata\nValkyr/Prime’s Talons\nNo customizing since her Talons’ design is all Energy-based!\nWukong’s Iron Staff\nExalted Weapons work in the following ways:\nThey appear in your Arsenal as an unranked moddable Weapon option once you’ve unlocked the Ability. \nAll Exalted weapons use the Mod classes expected for the class of weapon.\nMelee Exalted Weapons have their Stance Mod permanently displayed in the modding UI with access to Combos!\nTitania’s Dex Pixia now uses Secondary Mods! More on that in the Titania Exalted Weapons Dev Workshop we posted at the beginning of this week.\nWhile Exalted Weapons can be ranked, they do not count towards Mastery Rank (with the exception of Khora’s Venari). \nRiven Mods are not generated for Exalted Weapons.\nLimbo's Stasis has been changed to make it more cooperative! Now, Stasis only stops time for Enemies. Limbo's Gear and all Ally Gear will continue to function. But, because complete time-halting for enemies within the Rift is akin to godly power, the duration of the ability has been shortened overall \nfrom base 30 seconds to 15 seconds. This is of course affected by Mods.\nPlease see our Developer Workshop for more information:\n\n\nThe launch of virtual cursor controls on consoles brought many hotfixes to those platforms with much needed changes and improvements. Our first Dev Workshop looked at bringing D-Pad Functionality, while our second, a follow-up Action Plan, looked at what we planned on improving across platforms. Combined, the following changes are now live for our PC controller players:\nD-Pad support is here!  \nRestored button shortcuts in the Arsenal. \nChanged Relic selection windows to preview content on hover. To choose a Relic, simply select it. \nAdded the ability to auto-rotate your Warframe in the Arsenal (using the Right Trigger) while browsing item grid. \nChanged “preview” and “select” to be independent of one another in the Arsenal item selection (separate bindings displayed in bottom right of screen in Arsenal).\nRemoved the need to hold down and drag in order to select a Mod in the Modding UI. Instead, selecting a Mod will make it stick to your cursor like it used to, allowing you to move it with cursor control or D-Pad. Additionally, hitting “back” will deselect the Mod from your cursor without exiting the screen. \nIncreased the size of Star Chart node hitzones when using a controller.\nFixed category switch with controller LB/RB on some screens when hovering over a category button.\nFixed not being able to fish with Classic Controls.\nFixed LB prompt in Ability Menu appearing permanently after opening fishing gear wheel. \nFixed the cursor on controller moving to an arbitrary spot in the Inventory Sort Options drop down.\nFixed cursor automatically snapping to a button on the right side of the screen if a menu is open.\nFixed being unable to rotate your Operator while customizing with the Right Stick when your cursor is hovering over the item menu.  \nFixed being unable to rotate your Operator at all after fast traveling to the Transference room from “Operator” in the pause menu. \nFixed the “X” callout button missing from the Lunaro Practice Mode, which made it appear that the Practice Mode could not be activated. \nFixed button to send Amp Slots as a gift not actually sending the gift when using a controller. \nFixed controller RB and LB loss of functionality after accessing Navigation, opening matchmaking and then pressing B to back out.\nFixed pause menu button on controller causing a brief UI transition to mouse mode.\nThanks to your feedback, we are continuing our work to improve the cursor experience overall. To stay updated on the changes/fixes we are working on, visit our feedback thread here.\nIncreased Excalibur Prime’s Armor from 250 to 300.\nTeralyst, Gantulyst, and Hydrolyst no longer have regenerated Shields immediately after teleporting from being stuck.\nIncreased Titania’s Diwata damage to 200, Critical Chance to 20% and Critical Multiplier to 2x.\nSlightly lowered the Battalyst and Conculyst's base health from 1300 to 1150.\nSlightly reduced the Battalyst's projectile damage.\nYou can now include “&” in your Zaw weapon Entitling.\nGeneral audio polish for Sanctuary Onslaught.\nFollowing what we started in our previous mainline, we’ve made thousands more micro-optimizations to hundreds of scripts, including Warframe Powers, Precepts, Enemy Logic, Weapon Behaviors, Game-Modes, and the UI.\nAncient and Scorpion grappling hooks no longer go through Gara’s Mass Vitrify wall.\nMoved UI Cursor Sensitivity setting from “Controls” to “Interface”.\nMoved Cetus Wisp and Maprico Tree spawn points a bit further away from water volumes in the NW corner of the Plains for gathering ease.\nAfter the target is captured in Capture missions, the level alert levels will automatically turn off after 1 minute, and enemy spawns will stop after 2 minutes.  \nUpdated the LOC for Banshee’s Sound Quake Augment to “Forgoes channeling to create a shockwave that deals 20x damage at the epicenter, gradually weakening as it expands out\".\nStunning or knocking down Conculysts during their whirlwind ability and Battalysts during their omnidirectional laser ability now cancels the ability. \nRemoved Steam controller icons from the list of selectable sets and swapped them with the Xbox One icons.\nRemoved the “Max Enemy Count Reached” message from Simulacrum enemy selector when first opening it and selecting enemies. It will now only appear when you attempt to spawn enemies and there isn't enough space.

  "changes": "Beasts Of The Sanctuary: Update 22.20.0:\nOur lady of poison is taking the center stage with Saryn Revisited 2.0! Yes, that’s right! She has been revisited for a second time, and this time we took a closer look at increasing the fun factor by removing layers of complicated synergies and giving Toxin Lash and Molt a long deserved encore.\nRead all about our intent and full details on the changes in the official Saryn Revisited 2.0 Dev Workshop!\nIncreased Status Chance from 10% to 50% (scales with Ability Strength). \nA meter in the bottom right corner of your screen will show the number of affected enemies and how much damage is being dealt per tick to said enemies.\nRecasting Spores detonates all active Spores and will deal 2x the damage on an inflicted enemy based on the number of active Spores and the current damage per tick. \nVenom Dose Augment: Spores cast on allies temporarily grant them additional Corrosive damage to all attacks.\nAfter casting, Saryn receives a momentary speed boost for a short duration. \nMolt now scales similar to Rhino’s Iron Skin \nAll the initial damage it takes in the first 3 seconds will make it stronger. Any damage it receives after that point will target the absorbed health.*\n*Damage absorbed is shown in a buff indicator at the top of the screen.\n*Once all absorbed damage has dispensed, Molt explodes dealing Toxin damage to nearby enemies.\nNow has a 100% guaranteed Viral Status Effect on damage tick. \nIncreased range from 15 meters to 20 meters (at max rank). \nIncreased duration from 3 to 5 seconds.\nMiasma inflicts double damage on targets affected by Spores. \nWhen recasting on the same enemy it will refresh the tick duration and maintain the Viral Status Effect, but will not stun enemies a second time until the Status Effect ticks have subsided.\nIncreased Saryn’s Armor from 175 to 225 (at rank 30)\nIncreased Saryn Prime’s Armor from 225 to 300 (at rank 30) \nMade some minor FX updates to Saryn’s abilities! \nSpores received a slight improvement to the FX.\nReduced the brightness of Miasma.\nImproved FX to make her Molt cast more pronounced.\nSpores have been optimized and will be much nicer to your CPU! \nSaryn is also coming with a whole new set of sounds voiced by [DE]Danielle!! \nAdded Abilities screen stats for Saryn Molt speed buff & duration.\nWe hope you enjoy experimenting with her changes. We will be watching closely for your first impressions. As always, we appreciate your constructive feedback and encourage you to thoroughly play with the rework before sharing your thoughts: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/957215-update-2220-saryn-revisted-20-feedback-megathread/\n\nIf you recall, we added enhanced Dojo Decorating earlier this year with some other minor changes. Part 2 has arrived, and it brings with it new visuals and a highly anticipated room!\n\nDisappearing platforms!\nDeadly frickin lasers and pressure-pads that you should avoid at all costs!\nDummies you need to kill to complete the course!\nAnd much more!\nAdded 37 Tenno Decorations and 54 Orokin Decorations for your Dojo renovating pleasure!\nAdded new Pigment colors dropped by the following enemies: \nShard Black: Vomvalysts \nTower White: Condrocs \nDevar Grey: Tusk Bombard \nWisp Grey: Skiff Pilot \nMortus Pink: Kuakas\nDid you miss our Dev Workshop!? Read it quickly here \nit's short:\n\nWe have added 'GPU Particles' which replace the no-longer-supported Nvidia PhysX Particles. These GPU Particles can be enjoyed on all Platforms with varying intensity:\nOff/Low/Medium/High... LUDICROUS!\nMany particle FX have been converted, but we will spend some time continuing to upgrade our catalog throughout the year. Our new system is universal, works on almost all GPUs (really old ones might be out of luck), is not locked to a given manufacturer, and is not locked to PC! Console Tenno will receive this next update!\n\nIf you watched Devstream 110, you might already be familiar with our plans to change the Scrambus and Comba. Players can now engage in more cerebral combat with these enemies, using visual cues to take them down:\n\nTheir Nullify aura has been replaced with a power that they can activate in combat. Upon use, it creates an expanding sphere that nuffilies players’ powers, and disrupts them for 2.5 seconds.\n \nSimilar to the way shooting the Nullifier bubble or weak point can interrupt or prevent the aura from spreading, shooting off Scrambus/Comba’s helmet (or killing them) will negate the sphere:\n\n\n\n\nWith today’s update, you are now able to acquire an active Dargyn in the following ways:\nShoot the Pilot, causing the Dargyn to float gracefully to the ground for you to board:\n \nUse Loki’s Switch Teleport on the Pilot, leaving him grounded and confused:\n \nUse a finisher from behind while using Archwing, allowing you to transition from Archwing to Dargyn:\nIn addition to this new mechanic, we have also made the following changes:\nIncreased mounted Dargyn projectile damage from 250 to 450 and increased the clip size from 50 to 75. \nIncreased the spawn frequency of Dargyn patrol and idle Dargyn encounters when roaming the Plains.\n\nImproved Defense Target navigation by shifting the path towards the center of level.\nBuilt additional buildings around the Defense Target path at both Defense locations.\nAdded additional enemy spawn locations for each Defense location, giving AI more of 360 degree attack option.\nAdjusted Turrets within the level.\nAdded additional cover and attack routes for AI.\nThe rail upon which the Defense Tram travels on is now electrified!\nMoved hack panels to easier-to-find places in certain Grineer Shipyard tilesets. Hopefully you won’t get caught in a lockdown, but if you do, it should be faster to find a panel!\nWe now show you what camera is being highlighted in Advanced Mode.\nAdded tool-tips to help you know what's going on with the settings! \nCaptura, Text, now, supports, commas,!\nImproved speed multiplier controls for controllers.\nFixed 'Cinematic Mode' button not re-appearing when swapping settings.\n\n\nThe improvements to Khora keep on coming! We have a number of important fixes that really help with making Khora play better, as well as some changes!\nChanges include:\n\nIncreased the range of Ensnare.\nRemoved the Line of Sight check from Ensnare to make it more reliable. \nRange Mods now affect Whipclaw's AoE radius, but it is capped. \nKhora's Whipclaw can now damage decorations (crates, barrels, etc).\nKhora's Kavat now teleports to a given target instead of pathing there if the target is too far away!\nChanged Khora’s Venari animations from domestic Kavat to Feral Kavat. \nAdjusted a number of Syandanas to fit Khora better.\nTweaked Venari command sounds.\nFixes include:\n\nFixed a weird 'foot shuffle' animation with Whipclaw. \nFixed using Khora’s Whipclaw on a target causing all enemies affected by Ensnare to be released when the target is killed while ensnared. This one was particularly nasty in practice and made her kit feel weak! \nFixed Khora’s Venari getting locked in her Attack Mode when attempting Mastery Rank tests, which can cause failure on stealth tests (MR9 for example). \nFixed infinite re-whipping for Khora's Whipclaw by flailing the camera around rapidly. \nFixed Ospreys not being fully disabled by Khora’s Ensnare.\nFixed Venari freezing in place when entering Cetus from the Plains, and subsequently duplicating if you head back out, eventually leading to a hall of kitty statues.\nReduced explosion radius from 6m to 4m .\nLowered the Tusk Bombard’s base health from 350 to 300.\nFixed smoke trail behind rocket to persist for life of projectile (trail was disappearing after 8s of flight time, making it very hard to see the rocket).\nReduced explosion radius from 10m to 4m.\nReduced lifetime of fire explosion FX from 10s to 7s.\nAdded a damage element to those fire FX \nMinor Heat damage and Heat proc if touched.\nFixed flame trail behind rocket to persist for life of projectile (trail was disappearing after 5s of flight time, making it very hard to see the Napalm).\nMelee attacks (including spin attacks) will no longer sweep through walls or objects. Please read our Dev Workshop for Melee insight!\nNumerous weapons have received the PBR treatment: \nFlux Rifle (original material and the Shock Camo Skin)\nLanka (original material and the Shock Camo Skin)\nGram\nKraken\nMarelok\nGrinlok\nKronen\nKarak\nTwin Gremlins\nBrakk\nSeer \nhas also receive a new scope FX!\nThe Ceramic Dagger has received a new look! Previously it was identical to the Cronus.\nMade nearly 10,000 micro-optimizations to hundreds of scripts including Warframe Powers, Precepts, Enemy Logic, Weapon Behaviors, Game-Modes, and the UI.\nHarrow’s Condemn, Thurible, and Gara’s Shattered Lash (stab) can now be used on ziplines. \nGara’s Splinter Storm now applies a HUD buff when cast on self to help manage when casting on many targets. \nOperators now emit pain grunts when experiencing fall damage.\nEidolon Lures will wait until the Eidolon has fully disappeared to be auto-destroyed, instead of being auto-destroyed when the sun rises at dawn.\nRemoved the ‘Related Items’ tab from Syndicate Offerings because of purchase attempts resulting in script errors. \nOpened even more previously locked treasure walls in the Void!\nYou now spawn in the Observatory upon returning to the Dojo after a mission.\nIncreased door opening speeds on the Grineer Settlement and Grineer Galleon Tilesets. \nPolished the animations of the Steel Meridian and Cephalon Suda Syndicate handshake emotes. \nReduced the frequency of large Grineer Settlement tiles appearing in Extermination missions to help them feel a little less long.\nRemoved legacy loot crates from Void Onslaught tiles that should not have been part of Simaris' simulation.\nIncreased time given by targets in the Round 11 Mastery Rank Test from 3.5 seconds to 5 seconds and added aim assist to targets to make them slightly easier to hit. \nTurned down volume of bullet impacts on player’s Flesh and Shields.\nChanged the “Dead End” message that appears when viewing a Dojo expansion doorway upon hitting the room limit to say “Maximum Room Count Reached”.\nCrouching is now stateful! If you let go of crouch while in a small tunnel, your Warframe will now stand up when it can.You can also now  crouch while parrying.\nUpdated the ambience in the Simulacrum by removing the repeating music loops.\nRevised and improved several Rock and Cave materials and meshes. \nQuality of life changes for Grineer cell doors in Rescue missions.\nChanged the marker on the panel used to move the tram in one of the Grineer Asteroid tiles to use a different icon so it can’t be confused with the main yellow diamond objective marker. \nDisabled Challenges in some quest missions (e.g. “use your first power 5 times”).\nSeveral Corpus Rescue mission Co-Op door improvements and fixes:\nChanged default state to locked where doors were closed to fix spawning issues.\nReplaced markers with new type.\nAdded state icons to all doors.\nAdded a new marker type on panels for consistency.\nAdded activation sound to door context actions.\nAligned door hint with the ground and changed widths to fit doors (some were too wide).\nRemoved panels from opposite side of the door since they're never accessible.\nShortened delay before the door opens when panels are activated.\nFixed context action alignment.\nFixed missing shiny 'destroy' material on consoles.\nFixed door closing after being opened.\nFixed materials on tram door so it doesn't look like a dead end.\nFixed some broken material script properties.\nPolished Harrow’s Idle animations and his Agile/Noble Speargun variant animations. \nUpdated several ability stat descriptors to make them clearer:\nStandardized format across all Warframe ability descriptions.\nE.g. Range (Meters) #  to Range #\nE.g. “Health over Time #” to “Health / Sec #”\nAdded units of measurement to the abilities where appropriate \nM (meters), S (seconds), % (percentage), X (multiplier), etc. \nConverted decimals to whole numbers (e.g. Equinox’s Rest & Rage Wakeup Health Threshold has been changed from 0.5 to 50% for max rank). \nChanged “Range” to “Radius” for several Warframe abilities.\nSyndicate Pickups are now auto-marked on the first pickup! \nRemoved erroneous stats from Sentinel UI (Energy and Sprint Speed).\nLotus is less chatty in Fissure missions! \nShortened and simplified most levels for the Vor's Prize missions, making sure the missions are more suitable for new player navigation. \nAdjusted the Mithra Syandana based on feedback. \nArcane ranks are now on the side of the icon rather than in the 'name' field.\nYou can now purchase multiple copies of Arcane Blueprints in Hok and Quills Offerings.\nIncreased the in-mission volume of Octavia's Horos Sound Pack by .5dB. \nTweaked the Nova Lamia Skin to better match the Steam Workshop images.\nTweaked the Skeiron Zephyr Skin to be more shiny and metallic instead of matte.\nTweaked the emissives of the Excalibur Sentient Slayer Skin.\nTweaked the Maltzur Oculus List Skin to improve the emissive details.\nUpdated naming filter to allow players to use appropriate words that contain inappropriate words, like “assassin”.\nUpdated chat profanity filter to catch profanity with punctuation immediately following it. Those of you who live on the edge and have the filter turned off won’t notice a thing, but there might be a few more asterisks and a few less inappropriate words in chat for our filtered Tenno. \nExodia Contagion’s Infested grenade 30 meter damage multiplier now also takes into account your combo multiplier.\nMoved the Earth Tikal node slightly to not overlap quest text.\nOnslaught mission Credits are now rewarded every 2 successful Zones.

From an originally proposed damage deviator to the now metallic Kavat wielding queen of the Strangledome, her time is now. But, she won’t come easily. For Khora and Venari have been detected in Simaris’ Sanctuary, and it’s his rules that are law there.\n\nA balanced Zaw Strike for Nikana and Staff weapons. A steady blade for steady hands.\nA heavy Zaw Strike for Machete and Hammer weapons. Measure twice, strike once... heavily.\nA light Zaw Strike for Scythe or Hammer weapons. Lightweight, for flash and bite.\nA two-handed Zaw Grip for measured strikes and greater impact.\nA one-handed Zaw Grip for measured strikes and greater impact.\nIn the simulated universe of the Sanctuary, my data-immortals have fought each other countless times. Through this violence, I have studied and documented their true character. But my study cannot be complete without the power of the Tenno, the most powerful specimen in the system  — you. Your duty in this experiment is to kill as many specimens as efficiently as possible. In this chaos, the true nature of these creatures will be revealed... as will yours.”\nMust complete The New Strange quest.\nTalk to Cephalon Simaris at his Sanctuary in any Relay OR select Sanctuary Onslaught in the Syndicate World State Window tab.\nEnter the Conduit to the Sanctuary and maintain Efficiency against increasingly difficult Specimens for 2.5 minutes.\nEach Specimen you kill attributes to your overall Efficiency, with Eximus Specimens attributing more. \nEfficiency Stimulus’ are spawned per zone that each grant 10% Efficiency \nuse them wisely!\nEach zone after the first triggers a 45 second Focus Boost that scales in multiplier (MAX of 16x) \nkill Specimens as fast as you can!\nWhen a zone is complete, Simaris will open a Data-Conduit to a new and harder zone within his Sanctuary.\nEach week Simaris simulates a predetermined sequence of tilesets and Elite Specimens. This Onslaught is not for the leisurely, as Specimens are stronger and Simaris’ rewards for your Elite data mimic your efforts. Fight relentlessly and repeatedly until your fingers bleed \nthis please Simaris.\nNo Gear! The Gear wheel, Specters, and Emotes are disabled in Sanctuary Onslaught and Elite. Strictly no Dancing in Simaris' world. \nSimaris demands only Rank 30 Warframes can compete in the Sanctuary.\nAn overuse of Warframe abilities can skew Simaris’ data. You may find he has different tolerance levels against ultimates than first abilities. You may never even encounter this rule, but if you do, know that it is only temporary. \nEach Conduit entered/Zone advanced removes current buffs, active Warframe abilities, combo multipliers, and resets Energy to the respective base level. Harder enemies from a baseline! \nThe amount of Efficiency Stimulus that spawn decreases the deeper you go into the Sanctuary. Simaris is (somewhat) kind and will always spawn at least 1.\nIncrease your pace! The deeper you go into the Sanctuary the faster your Efficiency drops. \nSpecimens do not drop real-world things like Mods/Resources in Simaris’ Sanctuary. Rewards certainly do exist, though.

  "changes": "Shrine Of The Eidolon: Update 22.16.0:\nFirst, it's worth mentioning this is largely rooted in improved functionality across the board. We do plan on releasing even more updates soon with further lighting improvements and the 'Build your Own Obstacle Course', so keep checking back for that.\nAnd now, the Remaster!\nWith this Remaster we've aimed to do a few things:\nGive you better decorating tools.\nOffer you more decorations.\nGive you more functionality in the Dojo.\n*Please note that the following items cannot be contributed to the Clan Vault:\nAll Articulas, Displays, and unique items (Neewa's Drawings, etc)\nAmbulas Noggle\nStalker Noggle\nShadow Debt Noggles (Acolytes)\nKuria Statuette\nSacred Vessel\nOro Ornament\nRell’s Donda\nProminence Wisp Totem\nThousand-Year Fish Statuette\nAyatan Sculptures \nwe know many of you enjoy creating monstrous creatures out of Ayatan, but we want to prevent any Endo tears from accidental non-refundable donations. Once everyone familiarizes themselves with this new 'Decorations in the Vault are permanent' we'll loosen this restriction.\nMission type and difficulty level\nPlanet and node\nOpen spots in your squad\nA whole new setting called Controller Interface now allows you to have the option of AutoDetect! AutoDetect will try to detect what you're using, when you use it. So if you prefer the drag-n-drop functionality of the Mods screen, you can keep using a mouse to do that and see the regular keyboard and mouse UI, however, when you next pick up a controller and press a button, the UI will detect that and refresh to show you controller button Icons instead.\nWithin the Controller Interface you can also permanently toggle on/off the controller interface, which forces the UI into either regular (keyboard and mouse) mode, or controller mode (this works separately from auto-detection and Steam Big Picture mode).\nLastly, you can now choose the UI Icon set under the new setting Controller Icon Set. You can choose between XB1, XB 360, PS4, Steam, and AutoDetect (AutoDetect is essentially XB1). However, using a Steam controller will always result in Steam Icons.\nImproved how precisely you can alter the Camera Duration slider (increment by 0.1 when using the arrow buttons next to the slider). This means that the minimum speed for Camera movements is now lower!\nImproved optimization of Advanced Captura Mode.\nThe playing Camera will now stop if you decide to edit a Camera Position while it's playing.\nImprovements for adding/removing Camera Positions while camera is playing in Captura.\nBrilliant/Radiant Shards are not removed from player inventory until the respective Eidolon spawns.\nPlayers can now remove their Shard after inserting it into the Shrine (until the Eidolon spawns, at which point it is removed from their inventories and consumed by the Shrine).\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if a Host migration occurs before the Eidolon spawns.\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if Night ends before the respective Eidolon spawns.\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if players extract from that Plains before the Eidolon spawns.\nVomvalysts no longer drop Sentient Cores when they are auto-'killed' at sunrise. Unlike vampires, Vomvalysts are not killed by the sun, they just “go back to where they came from”.\nBased on feedback we are making some changes to the intensity of Visual Effects in Warframe, especially in the context of Eidolon fights!\n\nReduced some visual noise/lens flares on numerous Warframe abilities.\nReduced some visual noise/lens flares on the Operator Amp explosions/melee burst.\nGreatly toned down lens flare brightness and durations of Teralyst abilities (and variants)to help with visual clutter.\nImproved handling of rare cases of cache-corruption that would lead to crashes on startup.\nImproved hitbox sizes on the Eidolon Synovias (weak points) to make them easier to hit/target when moving.\nFixed an extra \"0\" damage number popping up for every instance of damage dealt to a Teralyst Synovia. Shotguns will therefore no longer shower the Teralyst with a confetti of zeroes when hitting a weak-point.\nBoltor Prime Status Chance increased from 32% to 34%.\nThe Shard selection screen will now show you how many Brilliant or Radiant Shards you have available to convert into Focus (originally this number would only be available to you once you had selected what Shard type you wanted to convert).\nSpoiler\nOpened arbitrarily locked Void doors/walls that held Rare items.

If a special animation is running when you enter the Appearance screen, it will continue until it's done and further special idle animations will not be played.\nRemoved the “while sliding” and “undetected” requirement for the \"Kill X Dargyns with a Bow\" Riven challenge to alleviate some frustrations.

  "changes": "Shrine Of The Eidolon: Hotfix 22.13.3:\nBeam Weapon behavior was originally changed to help with performance but as we've made optimizations to the game over time, we can return them to their original status of hitscan weapons with pinpoint accuracy and zero recoil. Or at least we think we can.\nPerfect accuracy and high fire rate is balanced by limited range and damage ramping up from 10% to 100% over 0.8 seconds when firing and decays back to 10% over 1 second after stopping. To help with ammo economy, Beam Weapons consume 0.5 ammo per trace \nunless they are Flamethrowers.\nOnce this launches (hopefully this week on PC), we're hoping for some practical feedback on the changes and your thoughts! It's a bit tricky to grasp the behaviour changes on paper, but in practice it's something you'll be able to detect quickly. Please bear that in mind when replying \npractical feedback will be the needle mover for any tweaks to come.\nWith such a huge change in behavior, comparing new stats with old is like apples to oranges so they are presented on their own below from our designer:\nBeam weapons now state \"STATUS\" instead of \"STATUS / SEC\" in the Arsenal because they can now Status Effect more than once per second (like all other weapons).\nThe Flux Rifle has a new battery charge up and fully charged sound to go with it’s beam rework!\nMinor tweaks to reload timing on Glaxion and Gammacor.\nTweaked the Synapse beam to better represent it’s Corrosive Damage.\nCurrently Multishot Mods do not increase Status chance. Multishot works like all other weapons except the affect is in the same spot as the base occurrence. We are monitoring this closely!\nCernos Prime Alt Fire is now silent as intended.\nIncreased the Fire Rate of the Zenith's Alt Fire.\nMade the additional projectiles of Talons and Castanas from Multishot spread in a more uniform/predictable pattern.\nEnabled weapon hit notifications for all projectile based weapons. A visual and audible example can be seen here from Devstream #106: https://clips.twitch.tv/GrotesqueElatedStingrayMcaT\nMap can now be panned halfway off screen\nWhen opening Advanced Map, the player position will be centered on the screen\nThe controller reticle will no longer be movable, instead the right analog stick will pan the Map around\nLeft analog stick now controls Map zoom\nPanning leeway will now scale with zoom level (so the Map can't be dragged far beyond the panning limit when zoomed in too much)\nIncreased the Endo awarded by Simaris’ Daily Synthesis Target by 2x.\nHold-to-Charge Abilities (Ember’s Fireball, Zephyr’s Tail Wind, etc) no longer auto cast when full. Cast now occurs on Charge release.\nAlso, if Energy drops below Charge cost, it will auto cast at the appropriate Charge level.\nCritical Chance, Critical Multiple, and Status Effect Chance now all apply to enemies inside Zephyr’s Tornado.\nLowered particle burst, opacity and particle count on numerous Gantulyst and Hydrolyst abilities in an attempt to alleviate performance issues and reduce visual clutter.\nLowered particle burst for Vomvalyst charge up attacks to alleviate performance issues.\nTweaked Kavat wall attack behaviours to prevent ‘supercat’. \nAdarza Kavat’s Cat’s Eye Critical Chance Buff no longer apply to Operators.\nSmeeta Kavat’s Charm Critical Chance and Energy recharge Buffs no longer apply to Operators.\nUpdated description of the Mod \"Entropy Burst\" to read \"Base Status Chance\" instead of \"Status Chance\".\nPicking up a Syndicate Medallion, Exceptional Sentient Core, or Flawless Sentient Core will now display the same special UI message like when you pick up an Argon Crystal.\nTalking to Onkko will now make all other Operators invisible, just like when you talk to Konzu with a busy crowd closeby. \nWhen customizing your Warframe under the Appearance tab, your Warframe will appear unarmed and idling to make customization easier without going into a blocking/armed stance. \nThe message that appears when you are over the Riven capacity limit will now have options to open the Dissolve screen, purchase Slots, or defer to later instead of having to go into the Dissolve screen first.\nCorrected a texture on the Repala Syandana to make it fully opaque instead of slightly transparent.\nTweaked the Saryn Nita’s Moda Skin to have a more pronounced ‘pulsating’ effect as requested by the creator.\nIgnis and Ignis Wraith are now usable in Conclave.\nFixed players not seeing the ‘killfeed’ when a player has been killed in Conclave.\nFixed not being able to equip the Knightess and Corpra Helmets in Conclave.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed the End of Mission screen both breaking (i.e. UI hang) and not showing the Nightmare Mod you earned when completing Nightmare Defense missions.\nFixed Sentient Cores from Vomalysts disappearing if another player joins the squad when a Core is on the ground in the Plains.\nMore fixes towards not being able to take pickups after a Host migration occurred if the new Host picked up the item before the Clients finish loading in.\nFixed Nidus’ Undying passive not working if an Oberon casts Renewal on him.\nFixed a script error when Client opens the Advanced Plains Map right after entering the Plains.\nFixed Warframe Abilities being inaccessible after equipping Archwing before accessing the Plains.\nFixed Syndicate Status Effect Buffs failing if one expired while you were the Operator.\nFixed Client Inaros’ able to become invincible by casting Devour on a target next to them and going straight into the devouring phase.\nFixed Amps and Zaws not being properly tracked in your Profile due to Gilded required before it is considered ‘Mastered’. \nFixed a decoration causing AI navigation issues in the Grineer Sealab tileset.\nFixed an AI navigation path in the Grineer Galleon tileset that was leading AI to spawn outside of the level bounds. \nFixed AI navigation troubles in the Eris Corpus Ship Defense tileset. \nFixed the Advanced Plains Map getting stuck when reaching the edge of the map using WASD or a controller.\nFixed Advanced Plains Map inverting WS or AD controls when sufficiently zoomed.  These keys now move the entire Map in the opposite direction (thus moving the focus of the Map in the same direction as the key).\nFixed 'convert all Shards' Focus UI option not updating to show the total Focus that will be received.\nFixed Simaris’ Daily Endo reward not displaying.\nFixed pressing Esc when viewing the Options menu causing the screen to close too early.\nFixed the scroll mouse wheel not highlighting the currently selected Warframe Ability.\nFixed Bullet Attractor Status Effect of Void Damage (Operators and Amps) becoming visually solid when frozen/petrified.\nFixed not being able to see Warframe Speed stat in the Arsenal.\nFixed changing your Warframe’s Energy color resulting in the Energy color of the Uru Prime Syandana also changing. \nFixed the Sabotage core appearing completely black in the Gas City tileset.\nFixed a crash when Transferring to the Operator. \nFixed Ember’s Fireball charging sound looping.\nFixed Ember’s Fireball missing fire FX when holding it fully charged.\nFixed dark lighting in the Frost Harka diorama.\nFixed a script error when accessing the Arsenal in a Relay/Cetus. \nFixed Credit Icons not displaying the appropriate color.\nFixed gamepad/keyboard button Icons changing color in the Chat window.\nFixed incorrect Emoji color choice in Chat.\nFixed the Junction UI disappearing behind the Star Chart as reported here:\nFixed the right Syrinx Shoulder Plate attachment clipping with the Mirage Mithra Skin.\n",

Use these to aid in your search for the new Eidolons!\n\n\n\n“The Sentient was a deformed creature, sent from some dark fold of distant space, crushing towers and citadels across Earth...”\nUntil meeting its fate in a climactic battle.\n“The device detonated. The Sentient's body shuddered, wracked by a cacophonous energy. Fragments of the Sentient crashed to the Plains and marshes and flatlands...”\nThese fragments are known as the Eidolons -\nmysterious titans that continue to wander the Plains and loom over the people of Cetus.\nMost of you have seen the Teralyst, a beast that rises from the watery depths every night. Legends speak of two more Eidolons that fell to the Plains, dormant for centuries but ever-present in the hearts and minds of the Ostrons.\nEidolon Hunters eager to prove their worth are trying to summon these creatures again. Are you worthy, Tenno?\n\nLegends say the Gantulyst wields an enormous boulder for an arm and radiates powerful beams of Sentient energy. The Ostrons built a shrine in its honor hoping to gain its favor.\n\nThe Ostrons believe the Hydrolyst is an omen of impending natural disaster. Stories describe a distinct, pungent aroma that precedes the arrival of this toxic beast.\n\n\nYou now have options to matchmake for Eidolon Hunts!\nIf you’re worthy, you’ll receive a guaranteed Riven Transmuter from the Hydrolyst (if captured). These consumable items can Transmute four Riven Mods into a brand-new Riven. Combining four Rivens of the same type (i.e Rifle, Melee, Shotgun, etc.) will result in a transmuted Riven of that type.\n\n\nEach Warframe’s stats and ability kits combine into a unique entity that offers different strengths and weaknesses. With 34 Warframes to choose from (and the 35th on the way), a Tenno may find there is no challenge they cannot overcome by making good use of the swiss army knife that their Arsenal offers. Some well-rounded frames do multiple things well, while others greatly excel in specific circumstances.\nWhen reviewing the Arsenal over time, our developers often find themselves asking: 'is this fun?’. That's the most important question to us, from the perspective of both the active player and their three squadmates. We understand the importance of power fantasy, but overbearing abilities can make squadmates feel ineffective by seriously disrupting intended gameplay flow. Conversely, when a Warframe doesn’t do enough, players may simply choose a “better” frame, sacrificing personalization and diversity for efficiency. Neither of these situations are ideal, so let’s shake things up!\nIf you've read the Dev Workshop, a lot of this will look familiar, but there are some minor changes! Our intent remains the same. We relist important information here because our Update notes are much more widely read than Dev Workshops.\nWe are revisiting all weapons and adjusting their stats to fit into some Mastery Rank grouping guidelines based on DPS and Crit/Status split total. With this in mind, we are buffing a lot of the weapons you know and love!\nAgain, a lot of this is as shown in the Dev Workshop, but our Update Notes are more widely read.\n\nSadly, not noted here are BEAM weapons \nthey should be ready soon, but we are revisiting them to be more 'like they used to be' in terms of damage instances over time but with a fixed fire rate. Fire Rate mods and their effects are still being determined. The Beam Weapon Category is simply not ready for this Update, but we are still working on it!\n\nConclave Weapon damage rebalancing has been done separately to account for the changes.\n\nWe calculate DPS based on sustained DPS which also takes Critical and Status values into account so our values may be different than yours!\n\nFor those of you in the Riven Market, please be aware these stats will not affect Riven dispositions. Player popularity / usage stats will continue to be the metric for that.\n\nOur data shows enemy weapons are unaffected by this, but if there are cases you believe to be wrong please note them in an appropriate subforum.\nWe sketched out Mastery Rank groupings of 0-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 and 13-15 for each weapon type with a minimum DPS and amount split between crit and status for each group. Using existing stats, weapons were sorted into the groups. If their stats were too high for their current MR it was raised along with any other properties to match.\nIt's damage places it in MR 10-12 but it's crit and stat split is way too low. MR, status and critical chance is increased to match it's new MR. Increasing status and critical boosts its damage so its reduced down to fit back into the MR group guidelines its original stats dictated\nThe end result is the high performing/popular weapons stats remain untouched outside of being placed into their intended MR group and the rest of the weapons are brought up to equivalency.\n\nProjectile based and low fire rate weapons were given more crit and status allowance when appropriate.\n\nFree weapons like the Dex series have been given Mastery Rank values to match their stats! We know these are grandfathered in inventory regardless of Mastery Rank, it's just for consistency!\n\nSome outliers exist that either don’t meet or exceed their Mastery Rank's allotted DPS and \nCrit/Status split allowance because of additional properties and/or features.\nGrakata \nexceeds Crit/Status split but is extremely inaccurate\nStrun Wraith \nDPS is lower than  its Mastery Rank group but it has forced stagger on hit and high status chance\n\nIf players continue, they earn the credits reward, and the wager target is reset so that they have the opportunity to reach it again for more rewards. If players extract, the game ends and they collect all the rewards they managed to earn. The initial investment fee is only taken away once, regardless of the number of times the reward was earned. If time runs out and players are losing, they forfeit all rewards.\nRequired points per tier are now 50/75/100.\nIncreased the required Index points from 25/50/100 to 50/100/200\nEnemy levels scale half as fast.\nChanged the investment costs from 45k/60k/75k to 30k/40k/50k, and changed the credit returns from 120k/195k/275k to 105k/175k/250k. The amount of profit for each tier remains the same at 75k/135k/200k.\nChanged the rewards to give the total credit return and take away invested credits, instead of combining them into the net profit.\nIncreased Teralyst base level to 50.\nReduced base Armor and reduced base Health of Synovia weak points a bit.\nReduced damage of Teralyst abilities to reflect increased level.\nInverted the Shuffle state to be bright when it's enabled, and dark when disabled.\nResource Drop Chance Boosters now affect Mining and Fishing, doubling the chance to get gems and the base number of fish spawns! (Previously only regular Resource Boosters affected the Plains)\nPrime Vault Bounty Relics in Stage 1 have been moved to be rewarded in Stage 2 and weighted accordingly amongst the other Stages. It’s worth noting that Bounty Stage 5 now yields the highest chance of getting a Vaulted Relic. Our intentions here are to alleviate players abandoning the Bounty after the first Stage.\nResource Theft Incursion and Bounty stage (aka Armored Vault) in Plains now lasts only 2 minutes (was 3 minutes).\nIncreased amount of Lures allowed at once from 6 to 8. Lures that have not been hacked to Tenno faction now get destroyed when their camp is deactivated, freeing up room for a new Lure to spawn when players enter other camps.\nReplaced Relics rewarded from Ghouls with Prime Vault Relics (Lith G2 & Neo E1 replaced Lith T1 & Neo S7).\nFocus Passives now apply immediately upon loading into a mission rather than requiring the brief Operator transition.\nOperators can now interact with Pets on your Orbiter!\nReduced the delay between using a Gear item and spawning Archwing in the Plains.\nZaws and Operator Amps now have a stat in your Profile.\nMastery Rank eligible weapons now appear first with locked weapons appearing below when viewing weapons in the Market and Arsenal.\nPressing and holding the fire button on an automatic weapon during a dodge roll will now begin firing once the dodge roll is complete. It's now consistent with pressing and holding the fire button before doing the dodge roll.\nInterrupting an automatic weapon with quick melee will no longer require the player to press the trigger again; the weapon will now resume firing once the melee attack is done.\nUpdated the Dojo Research completion icon.\nTweaked Dojo Tenno Lab glass to fix bloom issues when using custom Dojo colors.\nWarframes in the Tenno Lab will now spin instead of standing still \nso fancy!\nImproved the coordination of rain and stormy skies in the Plains to fix rain appearing during a clear blue sky.\nReduced head bounce movement in Chroma’s sprint turns.\nForma/Forma Bundle prices in the Arsenal Upgrade screen will now display the discounted price if there's an active sale.\nRelay Chat tab now goes to the right of the squad tab.\nEidolon Vomvalyst Lures now have a new distinctive mesh!\nUpdated mastered icons in Inventory, they are now using the teal version rather than plain white.\nMastered icons now also appear on Blueprints in the Inventory for items that have been mastered.\nUpdated Grineer Settlement icon when used in the World State Window (old one was just a distant screencap of Phobos).\nLowered and reduced marker range for small elevators in Grineer Asteroid tiles.\nPurchasing a Slot or Orokin Catalyst in the Upgrade screen will now auto equip/install. This reduces the amount of prompts you have to go through to equip/install said items.\nHarrow’s emissives will now always be on so you don’t need Penance active to see Energy Colors.\nChroma can no longer jump or sprint when using Spectral Scream.\n\n",

In that time, we will be closely monitoring how reproducible Performance issues may factor into this round and possibly revisit Relic placement. We do want to keep it the same on all Platforms so we'll need a bit of time to make changes.\nAll Bounties reward rotations from tiers 2 to 5 have a Vaulted Relic in it, and be sure to check our droprates site for the latest!\nUpdated textures to the Trinity Knightess Skin at the creator's request.\nImproved the lighting in the Market diorama.\nFollowers (Specters, Rescue Target, etc) no longer cancel charging if they switch targets while using a charging weapon.\n",

  "changes": "Plains Of Eidolon: Update 22.10.0:\nDisclaimer:\nTenno! This Update brings you yet another Mainline! You may recall from the end of 2017 what that means... it could be a bit bumpy! We're standing by to fix any issues. The major reason for this mainline is that we've done a massive Code audit that touched almost 3000 different core engine files to better optimize Warframe. While this Update brings you some new fashion frame options for Mesa and 3 new Augments, the majority of this Update is focused on bringing fixes and Quality of Life changes. If that's not what you're after, we've got lots of great stuff coming very soon. The Plains are going to get a lot more dangerous at night in an upcoming Update.....\n\nYou can now damage Vay Hek up to 25% of his total Health (was 10% previously) while his Propaganda Drone is active before it shuts off. This will result in less waiting around, and will make Vay Hek in Terra Frame easier to deal with.\nReduced base Armor of Vay Hek in his Terra Frame from 225 to 200.\nGhoul Lore Fragments are simply way more likely to drop within Bounties now.\nGhoul enemies themselves can now also drop the Lore Fragments (and Ghouls always have a chance to appear outside of Ghoul Bounties!).  \nGhoul Bounty tables have received new items including Nitain, Cetus Wisps, and Breath of the Eidolon!\nEquinox's Night-Form 'Mend' now regenerates Shields of Allies as enemies are killed within range.\nIncreased the drop chance of Intact Sentient Cores from Vomvalysts to 100%.\nUpdated description of Kwath (Grip) to properly inform of its stats: \n\"Light weight\" now reads \"Heavy weight\"\n\"increase in speed\" now reads \"increase in damage\"\n\"cost of damage\" now reads \"cost of speed\".\nUpdated the description on Zaw balances to say \"link\" instead of \"counterweight\".\nRemoved the Mastery Rank 2 requirement from the MK1-Furis.\nUpdated the Design Council tips that appear in the loading screen and removed some that don’t apply anymore.\nBounties are now Mastery Rank tiered! In the current system, a player of any Mastery Rank could queue up and join any Bounty, even the highest level ones! In order to avoid a mismatch in experience, we've simply set each Bounty to have a default Mastery Rank. It looks a little something like this: \nWhen the Acolytes are live, players will only see them in the World State panel once they've completed Vor's Prize.\nEidolon Lures now follow both Warframe or Operator rather than just the Warframe. The Lure will also now teleport to the player it’s following if/when it gets too far away/stuck. \nWarframe Specters are now much smarter! If you don't recall, Specters are craftable gear you can equip to summon an AI companion in battle. We've done a general intelligence pass on their proficiency with Weapons, and we've also updated their power-casting logic. Virtually every power is now castable with only a few exceptions! Specters CANNOT cast the following Abilities: Vauban's Minelayer, Ivara's Zipline, Titania's Razorwing, Nekros’ Desecrate and Shadows of the Dead, Excalibur’s Exalted Blade, Valkyr’s Hysteria, Wukong’s Primal Fury, Cloud Walker, and Defy, Atlas’ Petrify and Tectonics, Limbo's entire kit (save for the damage aspect of Banish), and finally Zephyr’s Dive Bomb. \nSecurity cameras now trigger more intelligently, the Corpus have upgraded their software. \nImproved the UI on Defection missions by having instruction text, aligning objectives, and better colour coding for defector icons. \nIncreased duration of Duality Augment to be 10 seconds at Max Rank (affected by Duration Mods).\nSecond Dream now has two vaults instead of three during the first Spy mission.  \nDisabled Stalker, Arc traps, and random transmissions during some quest missions. \nUpdated some doors which still had red non-interactive locked materials to new off versions. \nInstead of redundantly showing both Fire Rate and Charge Rate on bows, they now hide Fire Rate unless comparing to a non-bow weapon. \nChanged the background on selected Tenno customizations to be the same white as when selecting customizations from the Arsenal. \nImproved Sprint/Toggle Sprint so that sprinting stops less often. \nStanding in place with sprint key down no longer causes the sprint posture (for the purposes of Prowl and such).\nWhen a player tries to sell their last Sentinel, a more informative message will appear to explain why it cannot be sold. \nSomachord now continues playing where you left off when you return to your Orbiter.\nSomachord Tones now have their own marker icon when waypointing/finding one in a mission.\nRemoved the \"kill unalerted enemies\" or \"hack 1 terminal\" Challenges from The Law of Retribution and The Jordas Verdict.\nThe War Within Choice Scene has been changed to be untradable.\nTweaked the Cryona Syandana default Tint colors to better match the original Steam Workshop image. \nIncreased the Health of the Loki Specter in the Neptune Junction on Uranus.\nRemoved the equip sound from the Fishing Spear.\nChanged the 'disable sniper scopes' HUD option to be 'use sniper scopes' instead to fit with the positive style of other option wordings.\nIncreased follow radius of Drone in the Drone Hijack Incursion from 30m to 50m.\nLowered health of Grineer Auto Turrets from 1250 to 1100. \nLowered health from 650 to 550 and armor from 100 to 75 of the big Dropship Turret.\nTweaked wording/order in the Landing Craft menu:\nRenamed ‘PLACE DECORATIONS’ to ‘DECORATE’\nRenamed ‘CUSTOMIZE INTERIOR’ to ‘INTERIOR COLORS’\nFlipped the order of those two options\nNox enemies will now react when being damaged by a Stealth attack. Before they would remain not alerted after taking some stealthy damage.\nOperators will now automatically go back into Void Mode after a Void Blast if crouch is still being held (and they have enough Energy).\nReplaced old damaged Liset ship in Vor’s Prize cinematic with new damaged version.\nSabotage missions on Settlement, Shipyards, and Gas City tilesets now have 2 stages.\nThe Arca Plasmor received a change yesterday where headshots no longer deal bonus damage. The Arca Plasmor was designed to hit multiple targets with a high-status chance, but with wide wave projectiles and inherent punch-through, a single shot could result in multiple headshots. With it being a shotgun, it was never intended to behave as a precision weapon, and the bonus pushed it too far out of that mold.\nHowever! While this has changed, headshots should still deal damage (without the multiplier). Currently, there is a bug where headshots deal absolutely 0 damage. This is obviously not intended, and we are working on a fix to resolve this issue.    \nWe apologize for missing this in the original version of the update notes for 22.10.0! As we’ve mentioned before, mainline updates can be a bit rocky (last night’s 4 a.m. ET hotfix for example). Thank you for your understanding.\nConclave Stance Fateful Truth Leading Blade combo now only hits once during the dash.\nConclave Stance Fateful Truth Sudden Spring combo damage reduced.\n",

We do not want to ship something that we are unable to Hotfix for more than a week.\nWe have plans to make 2018 kickoff with long overdue reviews. Enjoy your holidays with some new gear and more while we enjoy ours, and we'll return in 2018 well rested and ready to rock!\nFragments in your Codex are now categorized based on their origin (Cephalon, Cetus, Gara, and Ghouls).  \nYou can now replay Bounties for Standing!\nYou can now use Emotes in your Orbiter! Deep bows all around.\nMirage's Hall of Mirrors casting animation has been changed to match the style of the Mirage Prime trailer! \nRemoved reticle animation when sprinting due to feedback. \nImproved sound ambience and performance on a Grineer Settlement tileset door. \nThe body tendrils on Nezha’s Yaksha Tennogen Skin is now tintable and will take tints from the tertiary slot. \nLieutenant Lech Kril changes: \nLech Kril will now prioritize using his ice abilities instead of melee when he can.\nUpon destroying Lech Kril's backpack, his ice abilities will have their cooldowns reset to reduce time spent waiting around.\nChanged Lech Kril's Ice Wave ability so that it doesn’t halt the fight when players are meleeing him. \nAdded FX to Lech Kril's weakspot that changes tint based on how much damage his backpack has taken to help make the objective clearer to new player. \nVery slightly tweaked hitbox location for backpack to try and achieve more consistent damage. \nWhen Decorating your Dojo, your selected Decoration will now be deselected if you type into the search bar and the Decoration in question does not appear on the results page. This should help prevent players accidentally building the wrong item!\nAmbulas is now immune to Viral Damage. This will fix issues where Ambulas becomes unhackable.\nReset Dynamic Resolution back to off by default because on some systems it seems to malfunction.\n",

To place, open your decoration tool and select “Warframe Articula”. Once you’ve found the perfect spot, customize by selecting from your existing loadouts, choosing a pose from the “Warframe Gun Pose Set”, and swapping weapons!

  "changes": "Plains Of Eidolon: Update 22.6.0:\nTenno!\nWe’re bringing you what we call a “mainline” update today. This is every fix and QoL change we have been working on since October in addition to content drops. 22.6.0 sets the stage for a bigger end of year Update that includes Khora and more!\nIt’s important to note that sometimes mainline updates can be rocky since they have deep overhauls for optimization within.\nWe will be actively watching for bugs and your feedback on the additions and changes below!\nThe Plains of Eidolon now have changing weather patterns! This new dynamic weather system brings rain, lightning, rolling thunder, as well as fluctuating wind and cloud patterns. The Plains can shift from sunshine to rain (and vice versa) during the day and night, and rain will linger for a reasonable amount of time.\nJumping in puddles isn’t the only good thing about being out in the Plains during the rain! Take advantage of increased fish spawns and reduced visibility for the Grineer while it is raining.\nA rain slider has also been added to the Plains of Eidolon Captura Scene. Adjust the slider from a light trickle to total downpour and capture your dramatic side!\nSince the launch of Focus 2.0 in Update 22: Plains of Eidolon, you have shared your thoughts and suggestions on where we could improve on Operator gameplay as a whole. Focus 2.5 is a reflection of what we’ve learned through your experiences, and acts as a jumping-off point for future implementations that need more consideration before they reach you (daily cap removal for example).\nBelow you will find a breakdown of what has changed in Focus 2.5. If you would like to read more about our intent and motivation for these changes, and some of our future plans for Operator gameplay, head on over to “The Features of Focus 2.5” Dev Workshop thread .\nWe have added shared pool capacity! You can now upgrade your pool size using the points from any School you wish, which increases the maximum capacity for every school all at once.\nYou can increase pool capacity from your active tree. Simply select a School of choice as your “primary” and use its Focus points to increase the shared pool capacity.\nThe ability to increase capacity from within the tree itself still exists, but these points will contribute to the shared pool instead.\nThe costs of unlocking nodes across all trees have, on average, been reduced by almost 30%. The table below compares what a 5 rank passive node (like Zenurik’s Energy Pulse) costs before and after these changes:\n\nVoid Singularity’s pull speed has been doubled.  \nLightning Dash now costs 10 energy per cast.\nGuardian Blast now grants 160 shields at max, up from 100.\nProtective Dash now grants 5s of immunity at max, up from 2s.\nVoid Spines now reflects 100% damage at max, up from 25%.\nStone Skin now adds flat armor, 60 for both Warframe and Operator at max.\nVoid Strike now continues accumulating damage boosts over multiple uses of void mode, each rank adds additional attacks up to a max of 8.\nBlazing Dash now stuns enemies instead of ragdolling.\nWe are excited to see how you feel about these changes, and will be collecting your feedback on Focus 2.5 changes in the dev workshop we posted earlier this week.\nThe following Incursions can now occur in Caves scattered around the Plains: Exterminate, Assassinate, and Cache Recovery. The objectives in these Incursions are the same as they are in the Plains, but there is now a chance for these to randomly take place in caves!\nThe intent of the following changes is to make fishing a more harmonious experience for you and your squad! Until now, Bait, Dye, and Pharoma has only exclusively affected the player who used it. Moving forward, all squadmates will receive benefits from Bait or other fishing consumables in the Plains. The fish you see will still vary from player to player, however, the effects of these consumables will be shared across all members.\nWhen making this change, we also reviewed how each of these consumables worked and tweaked them slightly for the sake of consistency and balance:\nYou can now throw Pharoma and Luminous Dye like Bait!*\nDye, Pharoma and Bait now only work within a certain radius around its casting point. Any player fishing within the radius around this casting point will benefit from its effects.\n*In order for Luminous Dye and Pharoma to work within this system, they are now thrown like bait. They float in the water and affect all fish in the same body of water within a certain radius. This way you can cast out the Dye in one place, and all players will see the fish get highlighted as they swim near it. Multiple Dyes can be used at once, if you want to affect a larger section of the water.\nFinally, we made the following changes and fixes to fishing:\nAdded custom Bait throwing animation.\nActive Bait will no longer be destroyed by fish.\nReduced fish escape speed when spooked.\nFixes towards fish swimming through terrain.\nFixed rare case where fishing Bait would not float properly.\nFixes towards Bait being destroyed if thrown into shallow ponds where the bait would hit the bottom before floating to the surface.\nFixed clients being able to throw one more Bait than they actually have.\nFixed an issue where some fish could swim in the air.\nMass Vitrify is no longer invulnerable and now has sections that break off and explode as it absorbs incoming damage. The amount of damage absorbed scales with Power Strength and Armor. Explosion damage scales with Power Strength. \nMass Vitrify no longer has a duration and remains until recast, destroyed from damage, or smashed with Shattered Lash.\nGara is still relatively new as far as Warframes are concerned but since her release, we’ve found (and many players have found) that an invulnerable and almost impenetrable barrier doesn’t allow for a very engaging gameplay experience. We know that other Warframes also have Powers with similar issues, but adding a shattering component to Mass Vitrify is a change we could easily implement that is consistent with Gara’s glass theme while also making Mass Vitrify more interactive.\nWith these new changes, we can tweak the absorption and explosion values as necessary to make sure Mass Vitrify is both fun and effective. Please keep your feedback constructive and let us know what you think after you’ve had a chance to test these new changes.\nReduced Electric Shield’s Energy Cost per meter to 1 Energy per 4 meters (down from 1 per 1 meter)\nWe previously announced changes to Discharge in this thread. But after further testing, we found that the changes were a lot more powerful than anticipated (we’ve included a video below). As a result, Discharge has not been changed yet. We will continue to work on Discharge improvements before releasing them in a future update. Sorry for getting anyone excited prematurely for Discharge! We appreciate your patience.\nPreviously proposed Discharge changes that ended up with more extreme crowd control than expected \nmodded here for extended range and lower damage. (not live!):\nSpoiler\nReticle will turn blue when targeting allies and red when targeting enemies.\nReticle will show different states for hip, aim and sprint.\nContext actions will dim when aiming while they are active.\nAll non-endless Solar Map and quest missions now display short objective instructions for each stage with a matching marker icon in the UI, similar to those displayed on the Plains.. Some endless missions also have new objective text. \nSimplified and cleaned up any existing objective UI's general alignment, ordering and spacing to make it more readable. \nReworded language in some existing missions’ objective UI for clarity, and added more appropriate text to some timers instead of the generic 'Time'.\nFixed many small consistency issues and bugs with objective markers and replaced some existing mission markers with area markers where appropriate.\nAdded area markers to Hive missions to cover highlight areas where the destroyable tumor nodes spawned around each hive.\nDuring long dialog stages in quests, there will now always be an area marker so that players don't get confused about where they should be.\nChanged timer description in Rescue missions to “Time Limit” instead of “Time Left”. \nIn-world markers for Incursion/Bounty objectives locations will no longer disappear for others when someone reaches it first \nit will persist for players who aren't in the area yet. \nIn-world markers for Incursion/Bounty objectives will reappear if you leave the objective area.\nThe countdown timer when leaving the perimeters of an objective in the Plains has moved to a more visible spot in the UI. It also states that you are “abandoning objective”. \nChanged the marker for downed Capture targets from red to a yellow objective marker \nthis will make it clearer to players that they need to use the context action instead of continuing to damage the target.\nObjective timers are now greyed out when paused.\n'Get to extraction' objective appears on the UI when extraction is enabled (excludes missions where extraction is optional).\nExtraction Timer text changed from 'Time:' to 'Extracting In:' so it can't be confused with other active timers.\nSome missions with large extraction zones like landing pads now use a green area extraction marker. Adjusted some extraction zones so that they fill the whole landing pad and marker area, instead of half of a landing pad.\nRemoved panels from Corpus doors which never did anything to avoid new player confusion because they would light up during lockdowns.\nFixed missing markers on Corpus co-op doors.\nThe Rescue Target in the Plains now has a HUD health indicator located under your mini-map.  \nFixed objective waypoint not disappearing after successfully destroying the Reactor in Sabotage missions.\nFixed Bounty waypoint directing players to extraction when Archwing is immediately deployed upon entering the Plains. \nFixed objective waypoint not disappearing after successfully taking the Vessel from the tomb in the last mission of the Sands of Inaros Quest.\nFixed some Markers being stuck in the at origin on the minimap. \nFixed unlocked icon appearing very dimly on Grineer doors.\nMade performance and memory optimizations to the Plains of Eidolon and other tilesets. If you were experiencing crashes before, we hope that these changes will be the fix!\nThe Corpus Gas City and Grineer Settlement tilesets have received an audio remaster! We revised the sounds in these tiles and used updated engine tech so that certain ambient sounds are more noticeable and clear. The remaster adds more character and personality to the audio and will also make enemies easier to pick out. \nTime between Incursions will increase if you let an Incursion alert expire.

Gold for blood. Blood for gold.\nCetus requires you to earn Standing to unlock rewards from its people. The Daily Standing Cap for Cetus works identically to all other Syndicates, and can be viewed under your Profile!\nAs you venture through Cetus, you will encounter many unique townspeople. Pay close attention to their barks and replies, for each encounter can tell a different story:\nFOSFORs can also be purchased from Nakak! Fosfors do more than just signal your position \nblast these flares into the sky (when equipped in your Gear wheel) for a significantly increased Affinity Range while active!\n\nYou have long dreamed of your perfect blade! Dream no longer, at master craftsman Hok's anvil your dreams will become reality.

Be sure to view Hok's Other Services to find out how to make your Zaw (and other Melee weapons) your own!\nThe Plains of Eidolon is an ancient battlefield where Sentients fought to destroy the Orokin Tower that the Ostrons now call home. The Sentients failed and died, leaving behind an ancient graveyard throughout the Landscape. The towering Spectral Sentients known as Eidolons survived the Old War. Every night they ascend from the waters and wander the Plains in search of what they’ve lost. Small, deadly Sentients appear throughout the Plains and protect the Eidolon. At daybreak, they disappear and wait for night to emerge once more.\nThe Grineer have organized drilling stations and sprawling outposts throughout the Plains to excavate the technology of the Old War. Fight Grineer during the day and clear out their bases, but be fast as these Grineer will call reinforcements when they spot danger. As you venture deeper into the Plains, there will be tougher Grineer enemies so come prepared. When night falls, some Grineer will retreat to their camps and attempt to wait it out while reinforcing their outposts and repairing their equipment for the new day.\nSaving your Progress on the Plains happens in a number of ways \nmost of which are automatic!\n\nExperience the great outdoors as you fish in the rivers and streams.

There are 3 reusable fishing spear blueprints available for purchase, each specializing in catching specific types of fish:\nHai-Luk also offers Gear to aid in your fishing efforts, and 4 kinds of Bait Blueprints that may be crafted using components from filleted fish and Resources collected in the Plains.\nBefore heading out into the Plains, add your spear of choice to your Gear wheel in your Arsenal. \nFind a body of water, open your Gear wheel (or use your hotkey), and select your spear to enter fishing mode. \nAiming and shooting with the spear works just as it does when launching other spear weapons.\nAim at an unknowing fish and toss your spear for a chance to reel in your catch!\nUse your equipped Bait by pressing the Alt Fire button.\nBy visiting Old Man Suumbaat in Cetus, you can acquire a Cutter to carve resources straight from the rocks of the Plains. Three different reusable Cutter blueprints can be purchased for Standing:\nOnce you have acquired your blueprint and crafted your Cutter, enter the Plains. The ancient battle has left traces of energy on those Plains, and this affects the Landscape, including the very rock formations! As a result, you will be able to mine interesting and strange mineral deposits with interesting and strange rewards. ‘Arcane Gems’ will be available from this system.

Find it and its blueprint in the Market today!\n\nIt's been almost two years since we released the first version of Focus. Focus comes as a system unlocked upon completion of 'The Second Dream'. After answering a series of questions from The Lotus, you (the Operator) chose a Focus school and began your journey through a series of Passives that you needed to unlock all the while earning the Focus points to do so. Then came The War Within, where your Operator became playable with a few abilities meant mainly to help you earn Kuva and participate in Quests.\nThe core purpose of this rework is to shift the goals of the Focus system away from supplementing Warframes and towards making your Operator more combat-ready. This means that there will be more of a balance between Passives and Actives under Focus 2.0.\nLet's start with some very important facts about all your accrued Focus Points and installed Lenses:\nThe Daily Focus Cap has increased from 100,000 to 250,000 Focus per day.\nConvergence Orbs now yield an 8x multiplier versus a 6x.\nNow we shall talk Passives, Residuals, and Actives.\nActives in their current form on the public build are at the behest of a 100 HP pool for the Operator. The Active and Passive Focus paths in Focus 2.0 aim to increase your Operator’s survivability and to give you the option to approach combat with added Operator support and armaments. Only a few encounters will necessitate this and as the game and feedback grows we will develop accordingly.\nAs far as the Focus Schools themselves, we have clear cut the trees of the old system and are rebuilding entirely new ability paths. We are also including cross-Focus nodes you can unlock within different trees!\nMany benefits of the new Focus trees are linked to the activation of the Operator or Operator Abilities (Void Dash, Void Blast, Void Mode).\nWe have reduced the Pool Increase costs significantly and distributed the Focus point investment more into the nodes.\nOperator AMPS: Operator Weapons!\nTenno who seek out the Eidolon Hunter will be exposed to an Operator Weaponry system.\nOperators will be able to wield a new Modular weaponized system that attaches to their arm, called an AMP. These devices amplify the Operator's Void Beam and Void Blast attacks and channeling them in different ways. They are comprised of three components: the Brace, the Scaffold, and the Prism.\nYou can equip and customize your AMP in the Customize Operator menu aboard your Orbiter.\nTake your Captura to new lengths by purchasing the Plains Scene from Old Man Sumbaat! You'll need to climb the ranks of the Cetus Standing to earn this!\nDefection has been added to eligible Void Fissure missions!  \nAdded a new ‘shield-like’ objective marker to Defense, Mobile Defense, Hijack, and Sabotage missions.\nAdded a ‘Delete All Read Messages’ option in the Inbox. *Please note that this currently does not apply to Community messages.\nAdded a Corpus Outpost and Grineer Shipyard tileset level to the Interception mix for some variation. \nAdded a visual indicator when viewing a Mod that lets you know if you already own it. \nPrettied up materials for several doors in different tilesets. \nAdded a Screen-Shake toggle option! \nAdded two new alternate versions of the default Liset load screens!\nYou can now control if you want to accept gifts from All, Friends Only, or None in the Options Menu!\n",
  "changes": "Warframe Update 22: Plains Of Eidolon:\n\nOur biggest update, ever, Plains of Eidolon has finally arrived! First off, thank you for checking it out!\nIf you're new to Warframe \noh hi! You’ve arrived at an interesting time in our multi-year journey. We hope you’ll stay a while and join our little space-ninja community. Cetus and its open landscape, Plains of Eidolon, have been placed early on in the progression path on Earth so that you can experience them as soon as possible!\nIf you’re a Founder \na Veteran \na Prime Access supporter \nplease know that it is by your hand that this crazy update is even possible. This update is dedicated to you.\nPlains of Eidolon, with its expansive landscape and all-new dynamic game systems, represents the ongoing evolution of Warframe. Our continuing mission: to create a game that feels alive, that challenges its creators and its players alike. A game that lives up to the amazing community that has grown around it.\nSome quick facts you might want to know about how Cetus & the Plains of Eidolon work!\nThe Plains of Eidolon and Cetus operate on a persistent asymmetrical Day/Night Cycle. As the sun rises and sets, different gameplay systems become available! The details are:\nThese Update notes have close to 25 pages of information explaining the Update. The Plains of Eidolon is new for all Tenno \ntake your time and enjoy discovering how to make your way through the systems.\nThere are two energy sources for your Operator: 1 for Void Beam, and another for Void Dash, Void Mode, and Void Blast. Both energy sources regen over time, and energy pickups only affect the latter abilities.\n\n\nTo create more flow with Transference between Operator and Warframe, you can now seamlessly transition to your Operator and back to your Warframe at any time \neven when in mid bullet jump! \nYou can now double tap “shift” to perform a slide as the Operator. \nWhen in Operator mode, Warframes now have a 90% damage reduction from enemies if an ability is active during Transference. If no ability is active during Transference, you Warframe is invulnerable and untargetable.\nFor 2 weeks following the Plains of Eidolon, our first ever Twitch Drops Campaign is live!https://www.warframe.com/news/the-great-eidolon-hunt\nEverything you need to know about this campaign can be found in this handy image:\n\nIf you are wondering who to tune into, see here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/849289-twitch-drops-prep-and-exclusive-sigil-drop/\nPlains of Eidolon has been added to the list of eligible Sortie regions!\nThe Void has been added to the list of eligible Sortie regions! Sorties that occur in the Void will have every mission take place in the Void. \nModular Melee Rivens have been added to the Sortie Reward Pool! These are different from Melee Rivens in that they are made for Zaw weapon combinations.\nKuva (6000) has been added to Sortie Rewards.\nLenses have been removed from Sortie Rewards \nbasic Lenses have been added to Bounties.\nOne of Warframe’s biggest appeals is the diverse selection of weaponry. Even within the subclasses of rifles and pistols, there is huge variety to be found, such as the distinction between projectile weapons (firing physical projectiles which move through space, like the Boltor) and hitscan weapons (firing draws an imaginary line between the gun and the point aimed at, doing damage instantly to whatever it hits, like the Soma). For obvious reasons, hitscans are very effective at long distances \nthis has never been an issue with Warframe’s tileset-based gameplay, but as we shot enemies from a kilometer away in the plains with our pistols, we knew something had to be done.\n \nWith the release of Plains of Eidolon, most weapons will have a form of damage falloff added, to reduce their effectiveness at extremely long distances. But don’t panic! This damage falloff will only be noticeable at extreme ranges (greater than 300m). Across all of our current tilesets, we were unable to find an unobstructed line of sight longer than 300m, so that is the point at which damage falloff will start.\nReticle sway removed from all zoom levels!\n1 meter punch through added to all snipers without any to start with (snipers with innate punch through unchanged).\n1 combo count removed at a time when duration runs out instead of all of them (decay vs. cooldown).\n1 combo count removed on miss instead of all of them\nAdditional bullets from multishot will each count as their own hits and misses in the combo counter\nCombo duration reduced to 2 seconds for all snipers apart from Lanka which is reduced to 6\nDamage fall off begins at 400 meters and ends at 600 meters with damage reduced to 50% past 600 meters.\nFirst level zoom +10% Damage replaced with +30% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +50% Head Shot Damage\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2.67\nFirst level zoom +15% Damage replaced with +35% Head Shot Damage\nFirst level zoom reduced from 4x to 3.5x\nSecond level zoom 20% Damage replaced with +55% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom reduced from 10x to 6x\nNext round is chambered immediately after firing instead of waiting for fire rate to cycle\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2\nFirst level zoom +10% Damage replaced with +30% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +50% Head Shot Damage\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2\nFirst level zoom +10% Damage replaced with +30% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +50% Head Shot Damage\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2.67\nFirst level zoom reduced from 5x to 3.5x\nSecond level zoom reduced from 12x to 6x\nFirst level zoom +15% Damage replaced with +35% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +55% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom reduced from 6x to 4x\nThird level zoom 20% Damage replaced with +70% Head Shot Damage\nThird level zoom reduced from 12x to 8x\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2\nFirst level zoom +15% Damage replaced with +35% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +55% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom reduced from 6x to 4x\nThird level zoom 20% Damage replaced with +70% Head Shot Damage\nThird level zoom reduced from 12x to 8x\nCharge rate decreased from 1.5 to 1\nSecond level zoom reduced from 7x to 5x\nThird level zoom reduced from 12x to 8x\nVasto Prime Mastery Rank increased from 0 to 3.\nVasto Prime damage increased from 60 to 70.\nVasto Prime status chance increased from 15 to 20%.\nVasto Prime critical chance increased from 15 to 20%.\nAll trace fire weapons trace distance reduced to 300m apart from Sniper Rifles which stay at 1000m.\nMagnetic Damage Status Effects now drain energy over time as opposed to completely draining all energy. \nChanged Ayatan Star markers to only display if you're within 100 meters or so range of the drop.. Amber Star markers will also appear larger due to their rarity and to avoid confusion. \nMaroo's Bazaar is now located on Mars.\nAdjusted the Nyx Carnifex Helmet and Skin colors to match original design. \nToned down the density of the Zenistars FX.\nRemoved stagger on hit from Grineer Flameblade units.\nCapture missions will no longer have the chance to change to the Exterminate objective in Kuva Siphon missions.\nImproved the mesh quality of the Angstrum and Prisma Angstrum to avoid blocky textures. \nCompanions will no longer lose integrity if a print is in the process of being distilled to prevent unexpected death.\nChanged metal material assignment for ceilings in the Corpus Tilesets to improve performance. \nImproved Corpus Dropship passenger animations and increased the speed at which they drop the Corpus reinforcements. \nCranked down the intensity of Nox’s helmet smash and explosion upon death sound FX.    \nThe following items are now color tintable:\nAll Vandal and Wraith weapons.\nThe Harkonar Wraith Armour and Syandana.\nUpdated icons for the Lato and Braton Vandal.\nImproved Jat Kusar weapon trail so that it is more visible. \nToned down lens flair on Nekros' idle. \nImproved Operator movement animations in the Landing Craft to remove weird leg and arm motions. \nChanged the TennoGen Knaita Mag skin’s default colors to match the Steam Workshop’s main image.

The blueprints will be removed and if they were under construction, the resources and credits will be refunded (except for the argon crystals for The Limbo Theorem, sorry!).\nAnti-MOAs are now able to spawn in Exterminate and Mobile Defense missions on Jupiter.\nTweaked the glass material on the Orokin capsules in the first mission of Vor’s Prize.\nUpdated Quaro Sugatra’s material rigidness to make it perform more like metal. \nUpdated the Liset’s appearance in the cinematic during the first mission of Vor’s Prize.\nCleaned up a small patch of unintended Infestation on the Corpus Outpost tileset. Looks like those Corpus janitors were really slacking!\nThe Gear wheel can now have up to 12 items!\nThe in-game Market now includes a separate category for Warframe Deluxe Bundles! \nThe Ayatan Star installing prompt will now only display once per Ayatan installing session rather than on every socket. \nImproved Hydroid’s Tempest Barrage when aiming through doorways. The Barrage will better hit the aimed location than the actual doorway. \nTweaked the Hydroid Graxx Skin default colors to better match original design.\nReduced the range at which NPCs see ragdolls / projectiles etc \nthis helps reduce the chance an NPC will see a body a long distance away and become alert.\nOptimized scripts used by Defection missions.\nOptimized the Infested Tar Moa sounds. \nMade many small performance optimizations to all Warframe abilities.\nOptimized Coolant Leak Mod slightly. \nRemoved being able to Quick Revive yourself when dueling in the Dojo.\nThe Sharpened Claws Kavat Mod now only applies the Armour debuff when actually dealing damage.

  "additions": "\nIn response to a disturbing transmission from Palladino, the Red Veil Syndicate’s spiritual medium, Tenno are compelled to investigate a dark, mysteriously abandoned Steel Meridian spacecraft found adrift. Inside the vessel, lights flicker and emergency lights strobe. All is quiet except for whispers of “Rap. Tap. Tap,” heard echoing throughout the lifeless craft. What does it all mean? Players must uncover the terrifying reality of what happened onboard, how the Red Veil might play a part in it, and more.\nIf you have completed The War Within Quest and have unlocked the Mot node in the Void the Chains of Harrow Quest will be automatically added to your Codex.\nChains of Harrow Quest is also replayable after completion \nenjoy it all over again!\n\nAlways prepared to sacrifice. This monastic Warframe uses the Void to bolster allies’ defenses and amplify their lethality.\nGet Harrow today by purchasing him in the Market for Platinum, or by completing the Chains of Harrow quest and finding his parts! His parts can be found in the Defection mission type, Grineer Fortress Spy missions, and from enemies corrupted by Void Fissures!\n\nPreviewed in the Operation: Ambulas Reborn, 6 Syndicate Weapon Augments are back and here to stay!\nAvenging Truth\nEntropy Detonation\nStockpiled Blight\nVoltage Sequence\nNeutralizing Justice\nDisarming Purity\nHarrow’s signature Primary weapon, the Scourge is a Corrosive spear gun that shoots wave projectiles with high Punch Through and guaranteed Status Effects. Thrown spears attach a bullet attractor to the heads of all enemies within 14 meters, and continues to pulse every 7 seconds and attaches bullet attractors for 3 seconds wherever it has landed.\nHarrow’s signature Secondary weapon, the Knell, has the utility of a sniper with the sight and zoom with the convenience of a pistol. This single round magazine sidearm grants 100% ammo efficiency for 3 seconds (that can be refreshed when active) and 0.5x Critical Damage added per headshot with a maximum of 3 stacks.\nHarrow’s signature Syandana.\n\nAn alternate helmet for Harrow. Find it in the Market or Alerts!\n\n\nReturn to Warframe’s first planet with a completely new look. Earth Remastered offers improved volumetric lighting, a conversion to PBR materials, and a new vegetation system, which create a mood and atmosphere far more advanced than the original January 2014 update did.\nThe new lush forests of Earth are yours to explore. This Update turns the formerly good-looking planet into a stunningly lush, beautifully lit, alive, organically structured environment.\nWe’ve breathed life into Earth’s ambiance by adding a greater variety of unique sounds as you move between the different areas, connecting tunnels/paths, and between the day and night cycle. You can now experience the sounds of more unique wildlife in the lush forest heavy areas, while the overrun Grineer areas focus more on the clunking and chugging of their machinery. With performance gains and a clearer and more focused mix, Earth now offers a higher level of diversity, adding to the overall experience.\nGhastly in appearance and even more unpleasant in combat, Nox is the newest Grineer experiment, a member of a tactical chem-focus unit, and enemy to the Tenno. Seared by an obsession with toxin and wielding a dart weapon that deals Toxin and Impact damage, Nox leaves clouds of deadly toxin whenever he goes. Take caution, destroying Nox’s helmet will release the toxin trapped inside. This Grineer unit is also extremely unstable and will explode in repulsive fashion when killed.\nYou may encounter Nox in enemy level 15 + Grineer missions.\nDual-wield any thrown Melee Weapon and a single-handed Secondary Weapon to destroy your enemies. Execute unique quick-melee combos and charged throws when dual-wielding for added damage.\nIncreased Critical Chance from 5% to 10% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased damage from 30 to 35\nIncreased Crit Multiplier from 1.5 to 2\nIncreased Critical Chance from 5% to 10% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased damage from 35 to 45\nIncreased Crit Multiplier from 1.5 to 2\nMastery Rank requirement increased to 1\nIncreased Status Chance from 25% to 30% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased damage from 35 to 44\nChanged damage type of recall discharge to Toxin\nIncreased Status Chance from 10% to 15% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased Critical Chance from 10% to 15% for Melee hits and projectiles\nDamage increased from 50 to 70\nRecall discharge damage changed to Ice\nIncreased Mastery Rank requirement from 5 to 6\nIncreased Status Chance from 15% to 20% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased Crit Chance from 5% to 10% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased Crit Multiplier from 1.5 to 2\nIncreased damage from 35 to 45\nIncreased Mastery Rank from 0 to 7\nIncreased Status Chance from 20% to 30% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased Critical Chance from 5% to 15% for Melee hits and projectiles\nIncreased Crit Multiplier from 1.5 to 2\nIncreased damage from 45 to 50\nKnockdown added to recall discharge\nIncreased Mastery Rank requirement from 0 to 10\n\nAdd Notes about your existing friends or create new Notes to send with your future Friend Requests!

Find Harrow Systems + new 'Bane of Corrupted' Mods!\nAdded Galleon, Asteroid and Infested Ship Defection missions to Dark Sector nodes in the Star Chart (Phobos Memphis, Saturn Caracol and Neptune Yursa).\nDefection has been added to the Sortie rotation!\nYour Arsenal of Melee weapons has awaited the Riven treatment and the time has come! Rivens overall now have a 25% chance to be earned from Sorties.\n\nFor the moments where you wish you had a friend (or 3) with you in the Simulacrum to test a build!\n2 new Mandachord instrument packs are here:\nEpsilon Instruments \nElectronic!\nPlogg Instruments \nPop-rock!\n*Find them in your Arsenal for purchase!\nIn order to let you show off Earth Remastered, 3 new Captura Scenes have arrived! These can be obtained in Rare Crates on Earth:\nGrineer Forest Factory Scene\nGrineer Forest Industry Scene \nGrineer Forest Water Pump Scene\n2 Quest related Captura rooms have also been added \nbut spoilers mean we won't say too much. If you've finished Octavia's Anthem, you'll find Cephalon Suda offering a new Room. Once you finish Chains of Harrow, Red Veil will offer a new Captura room!\n\nIf you find joy in neon colors flashing to the beat of killing Grineer, plug in that Razer Chroma and enjoy the show! Please note that Razer Chroma and Warframe compatibility is a work-in-progress and more compatibility will be added as we continue to develop it.\n\n23 existing PC Achievements have been added to our Steam Achievements! For those of who you have already completed these in-game, they will be unlocked on Steam when you play the Chains of Harrow update using the Steam launcher.\nWe’ve also added 6 new Achievements to PC (and Steam), bumping the total amount of PC achievements to 172. These were already available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but now it’s our PC Tenno’s turn to try their hand at them:\nDo you think you can complete them all, Tenno?\n\nSpecial item pickups now display on the left side with emphasis rather than on the bottom resource bumper. You'll notice items like Kubrow Eggs, Weapon Blueprints, and other special items picked up in game now have more pizazz!  \nMods that are already equipped on compatible gear now have a desaturated look and icon representing that they cannot be simultaneously used on compatible gear!\nWith Archwing 2.0, players can now fire their weapons while 'sprinting'.

  "changes": "Octavia’S Anthem: Hotfix 20.6.1oberon Changes:\nObaeron, Broberon, Goat Lord...these are just a few of the names bestowed upon our faithful Oberon. With the dedicated amount of continued feedback and passionate discussions about Oberon’s changes, the time has come to release another round of changes! Oberon Prime is right around the corner so the spotlight will be on him like never before. The changes below were brought forth from Dev discussions and by you, our devoted Tenno. Our goal has always been to give synergy to Oberon’s abilities, while still giving him a way to fill multiple roles in battle. We hope these further changes do just that.\nTweaked Hallowed Ground FX to reduce performance issues.\nRange Mods now apply 75% to Range (distance from Oberon) and 75% to Arc Angle of Hallowed Ground (before was 25% to Range and 75% to Arc before).\nOberon’s Renewal now heals friendly summoned units (IE Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead) at 1/3 the rate but consumes 1/3 the Energy drain for doing so. The change to have Renewal not affect friendly summons was met with varying opinions, and is now further tweaked to meet a happy middle ground. \nOberon’s Renewal Armor buff will be applied to allies anytime they step on Hallowed Ground while Renewal is active on them as opposed to them having to be on Hallowed Ground when Renewal hits them.\nRenewal no longer affects Nidus’ Maggots as to not prevent them from exploding (their intended behavior).\nOberon’s Reckoning Armor debuff is now based on the target's base Armor instead of current Armor (meaning no more diminishing returns).\nPull, Magnetize, and Polarize can now be cast while in motion \ntheir animations now only take place on the upper body. \nRemoved the .75 second delay at the end of Mag’s Crush cast.\nEximus units can now be summoned as Inaros’ Sand Shadows. \nTweaked the Endura Idle FX to better display ‘leafy particles’. \nSaved 10MB of RAM and reduced update and startup time for players that installed from Steam or used the Offline-Installer.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed being unable to craft the Destreza. This also fixes other items requiring Argon Crystals not being craftable. \nFixed crashing or failing to join when using the /join command to enter a player's mission.\nFixed crashing when attempting to enter the Dojo.\nFixed extracting as the Operator not applying Boosters to obtained Kuva.\nFixed a script error when attempting to Randomize your Warframe appearance in the Arsenal.\nFixed retaining the Fissure Primary Weapon buff permanently with Ivara’s Artemis Bow.\nFixed the Nidina Armor not properly applying chosen Energy color. \nFixed the Nidina Armor clipping into Frost/Frost Prime and his Skins.\nFixed some texture issues on the Ivara Youkai Skin. \nFixed some texture issues on the Repala Syandana. \nFixed seeing an empty screen when attempting to place a Decoration in the Obstacle Course. It’s fully intentional that Decorations are not placeable in the Obstacle Course, but the empty screen was not intended to appear.\nFixed underlying/default node's requirements being checked when taxiing to a Sortie mission (ie Kela's Judgement Points).\nFixed being unable to select a Relic in an Endless Fissure mission if a Relic was not brought in the mission from the start.\nFixed Hosts seeing Clients firing multiple bullets when they only fired one. \nFixed some Pistols having a weird left hand movement when firing.\n",

As of this Update, the Cycron battery recharge delay time is now halved when the mag is not empty. This means monitoring your ammo while feathering the trigger will be a good strategy when using this weapon. \nWe have made some tweaks to older Warframe Auras. As you may know, an Aura's Mod Rank determines how much additional Mod Capacity you get. We've increased the following Auras form 3 Ranks to 5 Ranks. With this change, we also buffed the Auras: \nSpeed Holster has gone from 80% to 120% at Max Rank.\nDead Eye has gone from 35% to 52.5% at Max Rank.\nEMP Aura has gone from 10% to 15% at Max Rank.\nSprint Boost Aura has gone from 10% to 15% at Max Rank. \nRemoved Lua Spy missions from Sortie rotation due to extensive Client loading times on min spec machines. Please note that we are working to fix this and add Lua Spy missions back into the Sortie rotation.\nAdded an extra line to Limbo's Passive description to speak to his Energy gathering in the Rift.\nImproved experiencing memory loss in the Relays. \nChanged \"CANCEL FUSION\" label to \"BACK\" when reaching max rank on a Mod when Fusing and when there are no pending Fusion tasks.\nReprioritzed a few screens in the Relay so that they load faster even when there's a throng of people around and you're competing for IO bandwidth for their loadouts.\nAdjusted the Rift weight of the Cycron beams in Limb’s Stasis to fix performance issues.\n",

If you are an avid Chroma user, you probably know the power maximizing this ability brings. At some point in Chroma's future we will need to revisit and use ideal methods for his Abilities; we will inform you well in advance when Chroma is under review. As you may or may not know, Oberon is currently under review at this time!\nUpdated the Ability screen and HUD buff numbers to be consistent with other powers.

  "changes": "Octavia'S Anthem: Update 20:\n\n\nDo you hear the music, Tenno? Faint memories of the Mandachord orchestra linger, and Suda wishes you follow it. Do as the Cephalon requests and be rewarded knowledge of an instrument from another time, the Mandachord. But, take caution... following her instructions may lead you down a twisted path...\nVisit the Cephalon Suda Enclave in the Relay, and speak to Suda to start the quest. You must have the Second Dream quest completed to do so.\nOctavia’s Anthem is a replayable quest! If you would like to experience it again, visit your Codex and select “Replay Quest”.\n\n\n\nCompose her song and then conduct the mighty Mandachord, turning bass, beat and melody into an anthem of devastation.\nGet Octavia today by purchasing her in the Market for Platinum, or by completing Octavia’s Anthem to get her Blueprint. Her parts can be found in the following ways:\n\nConduct your very own symphony, Tenno. Octavia’s abilities are powered by the Mandachord, a formidable tool used to mix Melody, Bass, and Percussion into a harmony of destruction. Compose a song before entering the battle by going to your Arsenal, selecting the Appearance tab, and hitting the “Mandachord” button.\nIn this guide, we will be using the Adau Instruments to get you started on composition since they are the default Mandachord Instruments. There are also 4 other Instruments available in the Market for Platinum if you own Octavia:\nAlpha Instruments\nBeta Instruments\nDruk Instruments\nGamma Instruments\nEach Instrument is in the same key (D minor Pentatonic), so if you’re feeling adventurous try mixing and matching Instruments to create unique compositions.\nThe Mandachord is comprised of 4 bars which are represented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 (seen in the background of each bar). Placing one note at the start of each bar is a whole note. Each bar is divided into quarters which are represented by the vertical lines. The tempo is set to 120 beats per minute, meaning each bar is 2 seconds long, and each slot is a 16th note.\nThe fastest way to start your composition is to tackle the Percussion track first! Using the Adau Instruments, place the outer drum sound on every quarter note, the second drum sound on the first note of the first bar, and the third drum sound in the third slot of every quarter:\nSpoiler\n\nSpoiler\nYou will notice the pitch rises as you move towards the outer ring of the Mandachord. Each Instrument works this way, enabling your notes to sound at the same pitch with different Instruments. Other Instruments have different bass-only sounds for this section as well, so feel free to experiment.\n\n\nSpoiler\nYou can also form chords by placing notes together on the same beat!\nSpoiler\nSpoiler\n\nSpoiler\n\nTry maintaining the same Percussion throughout your composition.\nStart off by playing the lowest notes for the Bass in the first bar, and then increasing their pitch in each subsequent bar. Do the same for the Melody section. The key to getting good results is to slightly change the notes that are playing from bar to bar.\nThere are composition note limits:\nThe Bass track has a 16 note limit per composition.\nThe Melody track has a 16 note limit per composition.\nThe Percussion track has a 26 note limit per composition.\nUse the “Volume Mixer” to adjust the volume for each track.\nUse “Track Isolation” to toggle each track on and off.\nUse “Reload” to revert any new changes back to the original selected/saved song.\nDon’t forget to save your compositions into a song slot. You can save a total of 5 songs!\nUse “Load Song” to select one of your custom songs or one of the default Instrument songs to load into the Mandachord.\n\nIn order to send and receive songs, you must own Octavia.\nTyping [Song] in chat will bring up a list of your saved songs to chose from. Hovering your cursor over a song will play it for easy selection:\nSpoiler\nOnce you have selected a song to share, a link with its title will appear in chat for others to save. Clicking on a song link will give you the following instructions on how to load the song into your own Mandachord:\nSpoiler\nOnce you have the song loaded into your Mandachord, you are free to edit it. You can also save shared songs, but keep in mind the 5 song slot limit.\n\nShow off your favorite Warframe and Fashion ‘Frame with the new Captura feature. Use a vast array of tools to compose the perfect shot. Choose from numerous available locations, spawn in enemies, slow down, or speed up time and compose a stunning photograph. Add more depth to your composition with dozens of filters, special effects and graphic options.\nHead to the Arsenal and select your Warframe Appearance tab. There you will see a new button titled Captura on the bottom right. Upon launching Captura, you can select from the following Captura Scenes:\nCORPUS SHIP MAINTENANCE SCENE\nGRINEER GALLEON CARGO SCENE\nINFESTED SHIP HOLOGRAM SCENE\nEach Syndicate also offers their own themed Captura Scene, available at a Standing price. Interested in applying your own background scene or having a solid color background to your Captura images? Visit Simaris in the Relay to purchase the Color Key Scene for Standing. Teshin also has Conclave Scenes to offer, visit him the in the Relay to add these to your Captura Scene selection.\nBe sure to share your Captura screenshots with the Community\nwe can’t wait to see how creative you get! https://forums.warframe.com/topic/776648-update-20-share-your-captura-screenshots/\n\n\nA high tempo rifle. Choose between automatic and semi automatic fire to lay waste to your enemies. Its primary fire rewards increased accuracy and fire rate with consistent shooting. Its alt fire will load up 10 ammo before being shot in a single blow. The Tenora can be purchased in the Market for Platinum or researched in the Tenno Lab Dojo room.\nThis fan hammer pistol, like the Tenora, also has two firing modes. Its semi-automatic primary fire will please sharpshooters. Its alt fire packs a punch (several) by emptying its entire clip in one trigger pull, but hold steady, the shots also have some kick to them. The Pandero can be purchased in the Market for Platinum or you can purchase its Blueprint in the Market for crafting.\n\nAn alternate helmet for Wukong.\nAn alternate helmet for Octavia.\nAccentuate the Kavat’s sleek profile with this enchanting decorative armor!\nWho is this gangly creature on your Landing Craft?! Who let this malformed Infested inside?! KILL IT WITH FIR\noh wait, that’s the newly reskinned Helminth Charger! With a whole new look comes a new attitude.\nFor those of you looking for the original Charger model, you can find the Helminth Degenerate Pattern as a Cosmetic Option in the Market available for Credits!\nJavlok, Buzlok, Ferrox, Harpak, Hind, Mutalist Quanta, Penthera, Paracyst, Penta, Quanta (Vandal), Stradavar, Tenora, Zarr\nAzima, Euphona Prime, Kulstar, Pandero, Talons\n5 new emotes are available for your hip-shaking convenience!\nGlissade Narta\nMaestro Narta\nPoise Narta\nTempo Narta\nPendulum Narta\nThe Relays and Maroo’s Bazaar now offer dedicated music zones, where you can share your Mandachord compositions and boogie down with fellow Tenno. Simply bring Octavia to one of the areas marked with the symbol seen in the image below, and select any of the Narta emotes listed above to start the party.\n\nDojos have a “free for all” policy when it comes to sharing your Mandachord compositions. Team up with your Clan to create symphonies in the comfort of your own Dojo, without concern of getting a noise complaint.\nDojo sessions are now hosted using the Relay system!\nThis means that Dojo sessions will be no longer be handled with the Host and Client method, eliminating potential host migrations or other host-related connectivity issues. Clan members will be able to invite other Tenno to the Dojo and leave without forcing their invitees out as well.\nFor performance’s sake, the Instance limit for Relays also applies to this new system. You and 49 other Tenno will be able to visit the Dojo at the same time before another Instance is created, and any modifications done to the Dojo will still propagate across each Instance simultaneously.\nAs a result of these changes, “Host” will be removed from the Clan Roles list since any and all Clan members will now be able to access the Dojo at all times.\nTrading in the Dojo now works similarly to trading in the Maroo's Bazaar where players can \"set up shop\". The trading post still shows all players in the Dojo with trades remaining for the day, but Players can now start a trade from the Trading Post or by interacting with another Player who is in trading mode.\nDuelling will use the original Dojo hosting system, where it will create one session for the duelling Tenno. Players will be able to trade in the Duelling Room, but not during a Duelling Session.\nA new and improved Mastery Rank-Up screen is here! When you become eligible for a rank-up, a new option to initiate your test will appear at the top of the pause menu (instead of directly under your name). Upon selecting to start your test, a new screen appears that shows you what Mastery Rank test you’re about to attempt, what rewards you will receive upon a successful completion, and helpful hints!\nSee it in action: https://twitter.com/PabloPoon/status/839946792078831616\nIn addition to the Dojo hosting changes, Clan Affinity will be awarded depending on the amount of effort expended towards bettering one’s Clan. This Clan Affinity will contribute to the Clan’s Rank and is awarded as follows:\nThe first time you construct an Oracle Room, Bio Lab, Chem Lab, Energy Lab, Tenno Lab, Orokin Lab, Duelling Room and Obstacle Course.\nThe first time you construct a Trading Post, Treasury, and Temple of Honor.\nUpon completion of Clan Research.\nThe amount of Clan Affinity earned by building Rooms or Decorations are listed in their respective selection screens; Research entries have been given the same treatment within the Lab UI. A Research tab has also been added to the Clan Profile, which will list all research and its state of completion per Lab!\nDon’t worry if your Clan has already done all or part of the above tasks \nthe rewards are retroactive! The appropriate amount of Clan Affinity has been given to all existing Clans with this Update.\nAll existing Clans are currently at the initial Rank, regardless of their Clan Affinity. Once its members complete the Ascension Ceremony, the Clan will Ascend to the highest Clan Rank attainable with their current amount of Affinity.\nWhat is this Ascension Ceremony? If you have earned enough to reach the next Rank, a new Decoration called the Ascension Altar will become active! To participate in this Ceremony, a clan member simply needs to interact with this device. Depending on your Clan Tier, a certain number of members must partake in this ceremony in order to reach Ascension, but under no time limit.\nParticipants will immediately be awarded Endo upon interacting with the Altar, and any remaining Clan members will be able to interact with the Altar and receive an Endo reward within 72 hours after the Ascension Ceremony has been completed. Participants from Clans who have enough Clan Affinity to Ascend multiple Ranks will be rewarded with Endo from each individual Rank.\nThe required number of participants per Tier are as follows:\nGhost: 1\nShadow: 5\nStorm: 15\nMountain: 30\nMoon: 50\nThe amount of Endo awarded per Clan Rank is as follows:\nRank One: 1,000\nRank Two: 2,000\nRank Three: 3,000\nRank Four: 4,000\nRank Five: 5,000\nRank Six: 6,000\nRank Seven: 7,000\nRank Eight: 8,000\nRank Nine: 9,000\nFor Clans who have earned the current max Clan Affinity at the time of this update, completing the Ascension Ceremony will award each participant (and any other player who interacts with the Altar within 72 hours after its completion) with a grand total of 45,000!\nTo remove any confusion between these new Clan Ranks and the existing ones, Clan Hierarchy is now used to describe a player’s position within the Clan, whether they are a Warlord or an Initiate.\nAll of these changes are the foundation for a larger system planned for release later this year, so stay tuned, Tenno!\nSniper Crewman now are able to deploy mini-robots known as Ratel. These fast-moving mini robotics units are quick and can quickly overwhelm even the strongest Tenno \ntake them out at the source!\nWe have increased the spawn chance of Sniper Crewman in Corpus missions. We have also reduced the spawn chance of Sapping Ospreys (which will mean less Sapper Mines) and lowered the maximum allowable simultaneous instances of Sapping Ospreys.\nBow and Sniper lovers rejoice! A new strategy for annihilating Nullifiers is now available. Nullifier backpacks are now equipped with Projector Drones that are deployed overhead. These Projector Drones are the power source behind the Nullifiers’ bubbles, and determine the growth, size, and vitality of the bubble. Here is what you can expect from the Nullifiers’ updated backpacks:\nWhen alerted for the first time, Nullifiers will deploy their Projector Drone to create a bubble.\nWhen in contact with varying ceiling heights, the Projector Drone will adjust its own height and reduce the size of the bubble to remain targetable.\nIf the bubble has been popped, the Projector Drone will return to the backpack for a brief period of time before being deployed again.\nIf the Projector Drone is destroyed, the bubble will pop and render the Nullifier permanently unable to make bubbles.\nProjector Drone health scales with enemy level.\nFixed Nullifiers so that stealth finisher targets don’t grow the bubble, as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/765409-bug-with-nullifiers-and-stealth-kills\nThe World State Window now has progressive disclosure and will only display the missions and Categories for content in which a player has met the criteria. Some of this is partially in place, but this is a more exhaustive change that ensures new players are not overwhelmed by seeing content they cannot play.\nAlerts will only appear in the World State Window if you have the planet unlocked.\nInvasions will only show if you have the planet unlocked.\nSorties will only become visible after completing The War WIthin.\nSyndicate Daily Missions only appear if a player is a member of a Syndicate.\nVoid Fissures will not appear until a player obtains their first Relic\nLimbo is a Warframe with one of the most complicated skillsets. When his skills are mastered, he becomes an unstoppable force of Rift manipulation. While many have perfected the Limbo, there's been a general sense he needs to be revisited to make the mastering feel more rewarding.\nWith this Update, we have revisited Limbo.  Changes to Limbo include the following:\nWhile in the Rift, Limbo receives a slight Energy regeneration. Additionally, enemies killed in the Rift will grant Limbo 10 Energy.\nLimbo darts in and out of different Planes of existence at no Energy cost. Tapping the roll key (default binding Shift) will shift Limbo between the Rift and Material Plane. Shifting into the Rift leaves behind a tear that, for a brief period of time (5s), Limbo and Allies can use it to enter the Rift. Limbos that enter the Rift through the tear can remain in the Rift as long as they please, unlike Allies who have temporary access.\nSend enemies and Allies within a small radius into or out of the Rift for a period of time. Banish targets must be in the same Plane as Limbo to be affected. For example, Limbo must be in the Material Plane to Banish Material Plane targets to the Rift and vice versa. Banished enemies will take damage when casted and will be knocked down for a brief period of time.\nStop Banished enemies in their tracks by putting them in Stasis for a period time. Toggle the ability on and move within the Rift to strategically set up shots around enemies affected by Stasis. Projectiles will stay suspended until the Stasis timer runs out, until toggled off, or until the 300 projectile limit has been reached, upon which your torrent of projectiles will be launched at the enemy.\nVoid energy surges through Limbo and into the Rift, charging enemies within it. Charged enemies that cross over to the Material Plane will Banish themselves and nearby enemies back into the Rift. When charged enemies die outside of the Rift, they surge and transfer the charge to nearby enemies.\nBridging the Rift and Material Planes, Cataclysm creates a sphere of Void Energy that shifts enemies within its radius into the Rift. During its creation and final collapse, enemies stumble and take damage. The sphere’s final collapse deals damage to enemies both in and out of the sphere, and scales based on the health and shields of ALL enemies in the Rift.\nMission objective items, such as Datamass, can now be carried in and out of the Rift Plane. However! Be careful not to drop these items in the Rift Plane, as they can only be picked up in the Material Plane.\nAllies in Cataclysm's sphere can now collect pickups including mission objective items.\nThe Rift Torrent Augment Mod will now grant Limbo a damage increase (15/20/25/30%) for every enemy affected by Rift Surge and has had it’s description changed to reflect this.\nToned down the FX while in the Rift.\nAs we near the staggering number of 300 weapons (including variants), the task of balancing grows increasingly daunting. At its core, Warframe is a co-operative game; having powerful tools is a boon to a team rather than a disadvantage. However, there are a few weapons that have such a dominating effect in missions that co-operative missions essentially become solo. Aside from the handful of dominating weapons, there are even more that have been overlooked.\nThe Miter is one of the oldest examples of killer concept with lackluster results. The next Update will bring the following:\nIncreased chance of dismemberment on kills.\nIncreased speed of Projectiles.\nCharge time has been halved.\nCritical Chance of 5% for a quick shot.\nCritical Chance of 10% for a charged shot.\nHit detection is now based on the size of the Sawblade.\nMastery Rank increased to 6.\nThe Harpak's stats aren't the worst in the scheme of Primaries, but it has received some love since it is often overlooked.\nRecoil has been reduced on the Primary Fire.\nThe Alt-Fire Charge time has been removed \nit is now an instant harpoon.\nThe Critical Chance has been increased to 20%.\nIncreased the range of the Alt-Fire from 15 meters to 40 meters.\nIncreased the flight speed of the Alt-Fire and updated the FX.\nAdjusted pull strength of the Harpak’s alt fire to have enemies more likely to end up near you.\nThe Hind has more nicknames than most Primaries (Baguette, etc), but not as much use.\nWe've added a single-shot Semi-Auto Alt Fire to the Hind that has increased Damage, Critical, and Status Chance.\nLike the Miter, the Panthera is a killer idea with lackluster execution. We've made the following changes:\nPrimary Fire has been switched to Automatic, and the fire rate has been increased.\nThe Status Chance of Primary Fire has been increased to 20%\nCritical Hit Chance of Primary Fire is now 10%\nThe Critical Multiplier is now 2x.\nAmmo Requirement is reduced to 2.\nSecondary Fire Status chance is now 35%\nCritical hit Chance of Secondary is now 25%\nHit detection is now based on the size of the projectile.\nMastery Rank is now 7.\nThe Paracyst is one of the more spine-tingling weapons in the Arsenal that really runs with the Infested theme.\nThe damage of the Primary Fire has been increased by 5.\nUpdated the FX of the projectiles of the Primary Fire.\nIncreased the range of the Alt-Fire tether to 50 m.\nThe Status Chance of the Primary and Secondary Fire has been increased to 30%\nThe Critical Chance of Primary Fire has been increased to 10%\nMastery Rank is now 5.\nThe Mutalist Quanta is getting more of a mechanic change rather than just stats.\nIt will have its Alt-Fire stack similar to the Simulor to make a large Infested Orb that you can shoot through for additional stats.\nThe Buzlok and its homing mechanism has been used for many creative moments \nbut ultimately this weapon has been overlooked.\nThe Ammo Requirement for the Secondary Homing has been reduced to 2.\nPhysical Damage distribution has been adjusted to 50% Impact, 40% Puncture, and 10% Slash.\nDamage has been increased to 60 from 45.\nCritical Chance increased to 15%\nCritical Damage increased to 2.5x\nThe flight speed of the Homing Beacon has been increased.\nThe Homing Beacon will now only stick to NPC & Characters.\nCritical Chance increased by 50% on targets with Homing Beacon attached to them.\nClip size reduced to 50.\nMastery Rank increased to 9.\nThe Ice Beam weapon: the Glaxion. Probably one of the most exciting weapons to imagine in combat, yet it has received a cold reception.\nCold Damage has increased to 333 from 250.\nThe rate at which ammo is consumed has been decreased.\nIncreased the Accuracy of the Glaxion.\nReduced the range from 30 meters to 24 meters.\nThe Ogris has gone through a visual Upgrade, and now it's time for a stat upgrade. To many, this was their first entry into Launcher weapons \nare you willing to give it another look?\nThe Flight Speed of the projectile has been increased.\nThe Status Chance has been increased to 35%.\nThe charge time to fire the Ogirs has been reduced.\nThe direct Impact damage of the projectile has been decreased to 100.\nAoE damage has increased to 600.\nAoE range has increased to 6 meters.\nMastery Rank requirement has increased to 8.\nThe Attica was the debut entry into Automatic Primary Crossbows! We've revisited it to perhaps bring it back into the spotlight of your Arsenal.\nThe Weapon Recoil has been reduced.\nThe Fire Rate has been increased.\nThe Flight Speed of the bolts has increased.\nThe Critical Chance has increased to 25%.\nThe Critical Multiplier has increased to 2x.\nThe Ammo Capacity has increased to 20.\nWe have nerfed 3 weapons (plus 1 variant)  that we feel disrupts the co-op setting and pace of gameplay for most groups:\nThe Tonkor's rocket jumping mechanic has long been obsolete since the introduction of bullet jumping, so the Tonkor now deals self-damage like all other launchers.\nThe Tonkor Grenade trajectory line now appears on holding the fire button (Default Left Mouse), and grenade fires on release.\nThe grenade needs to travel 6m before arming itself, it will bounce off yourself, other players and AI before then.\nThe Maximum lifespan of grenade has dropped from 5 to 3 seconds \ngrenades are quicker to explode\nGrenades bounce lower and explode sooner, making them more likely to explode where they are shot.\nThe Critical Chance has been reduced to 25%.\nThe Accuracy of the Tonkor has been increased.\nThe Simulor's entry into Arsenals marked one of the more unique moments in Weapon history. It's always been a little weird \nstacking orbs together leads to both passive and active death. The stacking itself causes damage and the fully stacked orb can be activated with your 'Alt Fire' button for an additional explosion.\nThe Status Chance has been increased to 30%.\nThe amount of Orbs required to make a full stack has decreased \nit used to take 5, now it takes 3.\nA Critical Chance of 2% has been added.\nThe AoE Explosion range (based on stack when expires or manual detonation) increased from 0.5-2.8 meters to 1-6 meters.\nThe Explosion Damage has increased from 50 per orb to 75 (225 at full stack).\nOn an orb stacking event (when orbs combine), damage range decreased to 1-6 from 3-8\nOn an orb stacking event, damage decreased from 150-250 to 20-40\nThe Simulor has had its max Ammo Capacity reduced to 60.\nConsidering the Simulor was the only Primary Cephalon weapon, it was easy to see a Synoid version entering Arsenals. Like its vanilla counterpart, it's always been a little weird \nstacking orbs together leads to both passive and active death. The stacking itself causes damage and the fully stacked orb can be activated with your 'Alt Fire' button for an additional explosion.\nThe Status Chance increased to 35%\nThe amount of Orbs required to make a full stack has decreased \nit used to take 5, now it takes 4.\nA Critical Chance of 5% has been added.\nThe AoE Explosion range (based on stack when expires or manual detonation) increased from 0.5-2.8 meters to 1-8 meters.\nThe Explosion Damage has increased from 50 per orb to 75 (300 at full stack).\nOn an orb stacking event (when orbs combine), damage range decreased to 1-8 from 3-8\nOn an orb stacking event, damage decreased from 150-250 to 20-50\nThe Synoid Simulor has had its max Ammo Capacity reduced to 75.\nThe only melee entry on the list is the Telos Boltace.\nThis weapon is receiving a bit more of a mechanic change rather than a purely numerical change.\nThe Slide attack will create a vortex that staggers and draws enemies toward you.\nThe following Slide attack (after a vortex) will radial blast and ragdoll enemies away from you.\nThis 'back and forth' will be on a cooldown.\nIf you have invested into a nerfed weapon, when the Update releases there will be an Inbox message generated on Login to give you a single 3 day Affinity Booster and a Forma per owned weapon to reconfigure your weapons as you see fit!\nRegarding any Rivens you may have or are looking to pick up for any of the listed weapons: you can expect small changes to stats. Stay tuned for more information in the Update notes!\nFixed the Tether Grenade Mod for the Penta cancelling Self Damage.\nThere is now a toggle option for how you want to fly: old vs. new! This option allows players to switch between the original Archwing flight system that we introduced vs the newer one we added. You can find this in the Options menu by going to Controls > Archwing > Toggle Experimental Flight!\nRemoved unusable Ammo Drops from Archwing.\nImproved the radius and 'suck speed' of Archwing's innate vacuum.\nThe Vulkar Wraith is now tradable!\nEmotes no longer remain active while changing your Arsenal in the Relay.\nFocus Convergence Orbs will now spawn closer to you \nbefore they would spawn within 40 to 80 meters, now they will spawn within 30 to 60 meters.\nThe Judgement points required to enter the various Rathuum missions and to fight Kela de Thaym on Merrow have been reduced! The Judgement points earned remains the same.\nYam now requires 10 judgement points.\nVodyanoi now requires 15 judgement points\nMerrow now requires 25 judgement points.\nAll of the Index mission options available on The Index node on Neptune have been removed, except for the Endurance mode. This node is optional, and is not required to complete Neptune. Since Endurance modes play out with no explicit end, we've made all Index enemies drop all Index exclusive modes so that you can remain in the same Endurance mission without missing out on drops that the enemies don't spawn.\nDecreased the hit box on the Grineer Rollers to better match the visual mesh.\nReduced particles from the Telos Boltace slide attack as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/764794-balance-the-telos-boltace/?page=2#comment-8431700\nRe-arranged Stims to appear together in Dojo Research.\nAdded mini-map marker for Dojo Transporter.\nRemoved bounding boxes of Dojo and Orbiter Decorations, except around Triggerable or Interactive sections of Decorations. This means you will have a much, much easier time placing Decorations! In a way, the sky is the limit.\nOverlapping Waypoint markers are now sorted by distance from player.\nBleedout Markers now hover above the player’s head and will follow them if they crawl around. A distance label is also added to this Marker (but will disappear when they are being revived).\nImproved visuals of Grineer Blunt.\nChanged translations on Resource Drone extract button to be singular if only 1 Extractor is ready.\nTweaked the location of a Kuria in the Shipyards!\nThe objective count in Mobile Defense missions will now disappear a couple seconds after all objectives have been successfully completed.\nUpdated Sargas Ruk’s face with wrinkle data so that you can see his anger in all of its wrinkled glory.\nChanged the console action text and its marker to hover over the console screen instead of floating above it in the first mission of Vor’s Prize.\nAdded extra navigation Marker in first mission of Vor’s Prize to make path clearer.\nUpdated the Corpus Turret animations for performance improvements.\nChoosing the default Ash skin for Ash Prime now removes all Ash Prime details.\nImproved cloth physics on several Sugatras (Boloket Sugatra, Scyth Sugatra, Ki'Teer Sugatra, and the Tentacyst Sugatra).\nOptimized numerous Dojo decorations for improved performance.\nImproved AI navigation in a number of Infested Salvage tiles.\nAdded PBR touches to a number of Corpus art objects.\nAdded PBR touches to a number of Dojo art objects.\nAdded PBR touches to numerous Infested Hive art objects.\nAdjusted the difficulty scaling of the Spy Mission portion of Vor’s Prize Quest.\nUpdated a number of Warframe Skin icons to make them all more consistent.\nLowered the specular lightning on the Smeeta Kavat to address ‘plastic’ looking issues.\nImproved the loading times of certain HUD elements.\nAdjusted the lighting in the Perrin Sequence Lunaro map.\nImproved the dual wielding functionality of Sentient enemy types.\nAdded additional Relay flavor NPCs.\nPerformed a lighting pass on the Infested Corpus tileset for improved reflection fidelity.\nDisabled the mini-map during the mountain pass section of The War Within quest.\nTweaked the visuals of the trade offering icon shown above player’s heads during the trade process.\nTweaked the visual appearance of a number of Infested coral art objects.\nUpdated the wrinkle maps seen on the faces of Grineer Marines.\nThe recruiting channel can now be joined while in a PvP lobby.\nImprove the spawning logic of interactive consoles in Mobile Defense matches to ensure a better spread.\nMagnetize used by enemy NPC Mag’s will now have a 1 second delay before the actual ability is deployed to prevent players from instantly 1-shotting themselves when facing these enemies.\nChanged flashing reticule hitmaker to be simulated locally for Clients to provide better visual damage feedback if they have a poor connection to Host.\nFixed an issue with the flashing reticule hitmaker when jumping or Bullet Jumping near enemies.\nFixed an issue with the flashing reticule hitmaker during Vauban’s Vortex, and Nezha’s Blazing Chakram and Warding Halo.\nUpdated NPC idle animations.\nChanged the tints on the default shader for the Latron as it was all dark, and not fitting the icon!\nThe Corpus Ship Tileset has received an ambiance overhaul.\nNote from George the Audio Director: “We wanted to give this tileset an audio refresh because most of the sounds were created over 3 years ago. In that time we have come up with tech that lets us play ambient sounds in a more realistic way and in a way that makes the levels feel more alive. In addition to the new tech, we also created a lot of new sounds that are unique to this tileset, in order to make it feels more Corpus-like.”\nPuzzle push-volumes now affect Warframes with knockdown immunity (Iron Skin, Warding Halo).\nReduced the MASHED Glyph diorama lighting in the Market to improve visibility.\nMade some adjustments to the Invincibility marker in the HUD so that it is more legible.\nRemoved Corpus Ship room that was unintentionally included in the Corpus Outpost tileset.\nImproved melee weapon holster transition animation for the customizable hostler positions to fix snapping.\nMade several optimizations for Relay performance.\nLowered the brightness on Excalibur's Blind cast and Drone Explosion deaths to avoid excessive bloom.\nNavigation panel information (not quest related) will now be hidden when playing through Vor's Prize.\nGrineer Helmets have been given the PBR treatment to better match their bodies!\nLowered the camera level when in the Archwing Arsenal to better view your Warframe.\nChanged Rhino’s Roar to only buff non-Tenno allies with a weapon -\nthis avoids the confusion when things like the Defense pod would suddenly start glowing strangely when near a Roar.\nUpdated the icons for the Chroma Drevni and Chroma Vojnik skins to include shots of the default Helmet (with the skin colours applied) to resolve confusion.\nChanged the Hostage/Rescue Target's in-world marker border from white to blue to match the icon color.\nImproved scaling and offset of items when viewing them in the Codex.\nChanged Atlas' Rumblers HUD marker from objective to Allied NPC.\nChanged Grineer Galleon tiles used during the Nav Segment phase of Vor’s Prize to show off a more visually interesting/less confusing route.\nCorpus Ship and Infested Ship door caps are now off instead of red.\nTweaked Mesa’s Noble Rifle animation to remove a pop in the movement.\nThe Braton Prime, Braton Vandal, Aklato, Lato Prime, and Lato Vandal have all had their firing sounds remastered!\nYou will now continue to be in a crouched position when jumping while crouching.\nWe have made some changes that largely affect the duration of Lunaro matches.

These means there will be two 3 minute halves.\nThe Maximum score has been reduced to 20: first team to 20 points wins!\n\nConclave Mods Final Act and Tactical Retreat now have a full screen effect when activated.\nConclave Mod Final Act changed to: +30% Ability Strength and +30% Casting Speed for 4 seconds when health drops below 50.\nEffects indicating that a player is immune to Knockdown and Impair have been made more clear in Conclave.\n \nOro is now automatically received from melee kills in Conclave.\nReduced the brightness of surface lighting in the Canyon Settlement map, added in new lighting system, and other lighting fixes.\nAdjusted lighting intensity to make team FX indicators more readable.\nAdjusted Oberon’s Hallowed Ground to have a more visually obvious edge that can be seen in bright environments.\nHydroid's passive now has 100% chance in Conclave, with its duration reduced to 6 seconds.\nAsh’s passive in Conclave changed to Bleed debuff from hits with weapons from the Nikana family.\nTrinity’s passive in Conclave changed to increase Shield Recharge Rate for her and her teammates within 25m.\nEnergy regen rate of Ember’s Passive reduced in Conclave.\nRemoved damage bonus from Mesa's Shooting Gallery in Conclave.\nNyx's Psychic Daggers now only seek target under reticule.

Enemies that are shot with projectiles that are silent and/or without a sound effect will now report a visual perception (rather than doing nothing). Previously enemies knew the exact location of their attacker when taking damage, regardless of the source. \nMore performance optimizations for the Helminth Infirmary. \nImproved Operator Void Dash aiming and collision on Kuva Clouds to be more forgiving.\nInbox messages for gifts no longer intrude and interrupt gameplay.\nTweaked the Sentinel Regen Mod description to include new invulnerability mechanic. \nTweaked the Atomos rumbling feedback duration when using a controller.\n",

Now to pop the Maggots you’ll need to cast Virulence on them and rejoice in your hard earned Stack accumulation. It’s also worth noting that with testing by our team, the Stack rhythm before and after this change wasn’t noticed at all. \nImproved the FX of Maggot explosion to better represent the intended area of explosion.\nNidus’ Ravenous Maggots will still attack but no longer latch on other Infested Maggots or Kuva Jesters due to awkward animations.  \nFixed FX, Maggots, & Health regeneration while in Ravenous staying around forever if cast by a Client who leaves.\nUpdated and improved the look of Frost’s abilities with fancy new ice textures! \nFurther optimized network access to help alleviate ‘Network Not Responding’ issues.\nPlayers who have reached the Riven Mod capacity can now continue to trade Riven Mods as long as the trade does not result in going over the capacity.\nIn an effort to address the issue of people not noticing the movement of The Kuva Fortress, we have made the loop completion time odd rather than a 24 hour cycle.

Underpowered, unprepared and forced out of your comfort, you must find it in yourself to improvise, not just to save yourself but the fate of all Tenno. The Queens' Fortress awaits, where both Warframe and Operator will be pushed past their limits as they slowly unravel mysteries about the Tenno’s past and their true capabilities.\nThe next chapter to 'The Second Dream' has arrived. Knowing what the Tenno are is just the beginning of your story. It is time to face The War Within.\nHow to access this Quest: If you've completed the Sedna Junction, you will receive this quest immediately on login via Inbox message.\nIf you do not receive The War Within Quest upon login be sure to have the Second Dream Quest and Sedna Junction completed. An inbox message will automatically appear once you have done so.\nOnce you've progressed far enough in The War Within to discover The Kuva Fortress, a new region will appear on your Solar Chart!\nPlay through and experience some of our most difficult and heavily fortified missions yet.\nWith this set, we knew we wanted to provide an awe-inspiring entry into the world of the Grineer Queens and Kuva. This set is complete with the latest in graphics enhancements like Volumetric Lighting, and includes some of the first ever Archwing Enemy incorporation into foot missions. Don't forget to aim up, Tenno.\nNew Music can be discovered while playing these missions, Keith Power brings us his creepiest compositions to date!\nThere comes a new way to obtain power \nfinish the War Within to receive your first entry. More information is out there… if you can find it.\nAfter you complete The War Within, Kuva Siphons may appear on Hard Grineer Environments (Sedna, Kuva Fortress, Uranus). These are side-quests related to the larger goals of the Grineer Empire. You will encounter new enemies here, and be required to use the skills learned in The War Within to prevail.\n\nFourth and fifth weapons exist… but defeating The War Within will be necessary to discover them.\nFrost & Frost Prime now have cloth physics! For years our favourite Master of Ice has had a rather static cloak, but no more! \nSolo Mode missions now start after just 5 seconds! \nDecorator Mode is now here for Dojos and Landing Crafts! This mode allows you to access a special menu where you can continuously change the items in your Landing Craft or Dojo. All the hassle of returning to the menu over and over for each placement are gone. \nAvailable daily Clem and weekly Maroo missions have been added to the World State Window under Alerts! \nA Mastery Rank 23 test has been added!

Thanks to feedback here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/679889-persian-kavats/ we've revised the visuals of this Kavat face. We hope you enjoy the new and improved look! \nAdded in a Graphical Preset option to the Display Settings tab.

These options now join the Conclave and Navigation as quick access points. \nA more robust Display Options menu is here! You can now disable or enable more Graphics Quality options!\nGrineer Fortress ‘Bunkers’ Conclave Map has been added for Team Annihilation and Annihilation! Take control of the security systems and turrets scattered throughout this Map and use them against other players. Take note: other players aren’t the only thing you have to worry about.\nArbiters of Hexis ‘Arbiter's Arena’ Lunaro Map has been added! The Arbiters of Hexis know there is more to the Tenno than just being good Warriors – they know them to be excellent Lunaro players as well!

  "changes": "Warframe Update 19: The War Within:\n'Finally it's here' the developers and players said in unison with tears (of joy?) in their eyes! When traditional developers pen their open letters at launch, it's often the last step after months or years of development. It's often a sign-off to address the people who are about to dive into the finished work of a collective group. But Warframe is far from traditional and our work is never done.\nThe War Within is here on PC! This is the next chapter in the story of Warframe. What we set out to do always seems a little wild in hindsight, but it's the thrill and ambition of storytelling that drives us to challenge ourselves and you. We want to grow and change Warframe in interesting ways. We're presenting you another chapter of growth today.\nThis chapter tells a story of your patience, our gratitude, and of course some wonderful evolution for the game. We're introducing an awe inspiring and dangerous environment: the Kuva Fortress. We're pushing our engine technology to bring you graphic improvements. We're bringing you a story about your past.\nThe War Within is also a reflection of lessons for us on how to feed, respect, and tame the growing animal that is Warframe. This update's name has outgrown itself and it represents something bigger. If you asked any of us 4 years ago what we expected to happen with this project, none of us would believe you if you showed us this day.\nWe are beyond lucky to have hard working people at Digital Extremes to bring this chapter of Warframe to life. We are grateful to have you to share it with.\nThank you Tenno. We hope you enjoy another Update that's free from us to you.\n\nEver since the change to the new Solar Chart in Specters of the Rail, the Invasion system hasn't exactly been exciting or novel. The War Within brings some much needed freshness to this part of the game!\nPrior Sortie Season Vandal and Wraith rewards can now be offered as invasion rewards by the respective faction. \nInterception missions have been added into the mix when playing for invading faction.\nWinning factions will now 'Occupy' the node for up to 24 hours. During this period, the invaders will raid the location for resources towards a mysterious 'Construction Project'\nThe mission type at a particular Invasion node will change every 15 minutes.\nThe progress of an invasion can now lead to a Faction Specific event! Watch closely as the Grineer and Corpus gather enough strength!\nFactions now pay an additional 1000 Credits each time you run a mission for them on the same node (up to max of 10K).\nFixed issues with Invasion missions loading to black and no spawning enemies. \nFixed Invasion progress not counting if a player was in mission during a Hotfix. \nFixed Phorid occupied nodes still showing the underlying bosses.\nSorties were introduced in The Second Dream. They originally launched with 'Seasons' that rotated with set rewards. Since launch we iterated in several ways, including adding repeatable/non-repeatable rewards and more. Now we bring you more change with The War Within: Sortie Seasons are no more. We now have a set reward list of rewards that are always repeatable.\nThe new pre-requisite to access Sorties is completion of The War Within. \nNezha Parts have moved to the Tenno Lab in player Dojos. \nVandal and Wraith weapon parts have moved to the Invasion System as rewards for their respective factions. \nSortie Rewards are now set as:\nVarious Endo Amounts\nOrokin Catalyst\nOrokin Reactor\nExilus Adapter\nA random Focus Lens\nLegendary Core\n1 new item coming soon (see below)!\nThere is a new addition to Sortie rewards, but this will be revealed upon completion of The War Within.\nInterception, Defense, Survival, and Excavation Endless Void Fissure Missions have been revamped and now function in a new way!\nFirst, every reward interval can have it's own Relic selected and opened (if you get enough Reactant per interval).\nSecondly, the reward intervals are as follows (for clarity):\nDefense: 5 Waves.\nInterception: 1 Round.\nSurvival: 5 Minutes.\nExcavation: 200 Cryotic.\nShould you collect the necessary Reactant per interval and open your Relic, a bonus will occur and you will be allowed to re-select a new Relic for the next interval! The bonuses are as follows:\nEvery time you open a Relic, you get a pre-determined booster. These boosters stack the longer you stay.  \nThe first interval: 1.25x Affinity.\nThe second interval: 1.25x Credits.\nThe third interval: 1.25x Resources.\nThe fourth interval: 1.25x Resource Drop Rate. \nThe fifth interval: a random Exceptional Relic (that can be used in the same mission). \nThe sixth interval: 1.5x Affinity (replaces first).\nThe seventh interval: 1.5x Credits (replaces second).\nThe eighth interval: 1.5x Resources (replaces third).\nThe ninth interval: 1.5x Resource Drop Rate (replaces fourth).\nThe tenth interval: a higher tier random Flawless Relic (that can be used in the same mission). \nOnce you get to the fifteenth interval, you'll receive a random Radiant Relic (that can be used in the same mission. \nBoosters continue to increase every set of intervals and are capped at double (2x).\nRadiants on every fifth interval past the fifteenth. \nEvery Relic opened will result in Traces!\nCapture enemy types are now split into 3 tiers\nEasy (1-10), Medium (10-20), Hard (20+).\nCorpus Nullifiers and white-suited Corpus Targets (capable of creating a Snow Globe-esqe barrier) no longer appear on lower level Capture missions.\nChanged \"X Offset\" option to adjust Holster Position to move along to edge of your Warframe.\nAdded \"Attach Part\" option to select specific areas to Holster. Standard Holsters also have this option.\nAdded \"Z Offset\" option to adjust Holster Position distance from your Warframe.\nVolumetric Lighting technology is here and has been implemented in The War Within quest!\nWe've also improved player lighting and added various weather effects to the game.\nImprovements on collisions, and clipping on all Archwings have been made across the board!\nValkyr's Paralysis no longer deals damage in Conclave.\nValkyr's Paralysis range has been reduced in Conclave.\nImproved the explosive visual effects seen when throwing weapons make impact on players in Conclave matches to better represent energy drain.    \nFixed the UI displaying the wrong half-time indication when rejoining a Lunaro game in progress.\nFixed Client loadout changes in the lobby not syncing properly. \nFixed an issue with Titania’s Razorwing ability appearing as ready-to-cast without sufficient energy in Conclave matches.\nFixed a couple of unintended hiding spots in the Forgotten Halls Conclave map.\nFixed a couple of map holes allowing players to see out of the level in the Freight Line Conclave map.\nThe Player Profile diorama now includes your custom Operator!\nActivating your Focus ability in mission now occurs on holding your '5' key (or whatever binding you have) rather than tapping. \nMade changes to some Motion Blur instances on power cast and damage events, we will adjust this based on your feedback! \nFixed some general behaviour with enemies regarding awareness of their environment:\nNullifiers now notice and investigate their bubble taking damage \nEnemies will notice and investigate corpses\nEnemies affected by Coolant Leak will notice that they've been frozen/slowed\nThe Landing Craft extraction door has received an upgraded look! \nMade several optimizations to host-performance in the Law of Retribution and the Jordas Verdict\nOptimized periodic single-frame lag-spikes that would occur in many missions\nRadial Shared Affinity no longer includes a stealth multiplier (if active). \nThe Kubrow and Kavat section of the Player Profile has been renamed to Companions.\nWhips can now use any longsword holster customization. \nScaled the Plastid Carapace ship decoration to match in-game size.  \nTweaked the original Grineer riot shield to be a bit more metallic.\nBlocking with the Silva and Aegis increases both Critical and Status Chance by 15% (max 60%) to next attack. \nBlocking with the Ack and Brunt now absorbs elemental damage. Example: Block Electrical damage, gain + Electrical damage on top of base attacks.\nAyatan Sculptures now show number of socketed Stars when viewed in your Inventory. \nReplaced outdated Mod tips with new tips about the Ayatan system.\nTweaked Relay hub room lighting to better represent each room.\nVenus \nV Prime is now a Survival mission instead of Rescue due to there only being one low tier Survival mission. \nYou will no longer be able to see or pickup Syndicate Medallions if you have already completed that mission prior to being invited. \nReduced the brightness when viewing Landing Craft Resource Decorations.\nChanged the default text for arrows from SKIN to ARROW SKIN.\nImproved transitions when selecting different Stance animations in the Arsenal.\nImproved the look of the fog effects on the Corpus Gas City tileset.\nAdjusted the blocking volumes on elevators on the Corpus Ice Planet Tileset to prevent players from being able to accidentally exit the level.\nImproved the sound effects for the Scorpion enemy type. \nAdjusted the minimum level of Bursas to help spread out their presence across the Star Chart:\nMission Level 15+ = Denial Bursa\nMission Level 20+ = Drover Bursa\nMission Level 25+ = Isolator Bursa\nTyl Regor is now vulnerable to Corrosive procs. \nImproved the overall performance of multiple Warframe ability visual effects.\nImproved Lunaro save detection.\nAdjusted the coloring of the lens flare seen while channeling.\nAdjusted and improved the sound effects heard when grappled by Infested Ancients and Isolator Bursa units.    \nStealth master tests will now wait for performed finishers to finish before resetting themselves.\nAdjusted the difficulty of Spy vault hack consoles to prevent the most difficult hack from occurring on mission difficulties lower than level 100.\nThe icon used to displayed dropped weapons from a disarm move now use the same Friendly marker on the minimap instead of the major objective iconography.\nThe Companion stasis grid will now display Polarization counts for pets who have been Forma’d.\nThe New Strange Defense wave count has been reduced from 10 to 5.\nAdjusted Rapier idles to minimize visible foot sliding.\nImproved the back-end spawning logic of AI types for increased performance.\nThe Grineer Shipyard tileset has received a visual update! Objects are shinier and rocks are now PBR\nwhoa! \nReduced the damage of the Static Discharge Mod due to the Prova dealing (at least) 5 ticks of damage during the charge attack.\nImproved motion blur edges to appear less disorienting.  \nImproved jumping animations to be smoother.\nRemoved the Void Fissure end of mission reward selection screen when playing Solo or if no other player joins. \nOptimized the memory usage of the flashlight. \nWarning lights and sounds will now play upon Raptor NS’ Energy Mortar attack.\nYou can now go to Maroo’s Bazaar even if you have reached your daily trade limit.

If you hadn’t guessed it already, Carrier usage represents almost 80% of the total used Sentinels, and considering we have more than 5 unique choices this needed balancing. Today we're eager to introduce a community driven experiment within the Sentinel class. This is not the final book in this conversation, just the beginning.\nWe've also mentioned Kubrow/Kavat are not off the table. What we want to do is measure. We know where Carrier sits in usage compared to the rest of the options. We want a calculated release of a change that will deliver on giving Sentinels the function of Vacuum, and see how it affects the usage of content in that category. The results are something we'll be sharing as it should be very interesting to everyone invested in this particular topic. The shovel in the ground on this will apply to Sentinels first, but Pets aren't off the table.\nWe're starting with Sentinels to have this contained group of content analyzed. We will be keeping a close eye on how all of you feel about the new vacuum as well as looking at metrics to see how the distribution of sentinel usage changes across the community (right now 80% of you use Carrier)! We will share results along the way as a team, as soon as this Friday on Devstream #81!\nCarrier’s precept has been automatically changed to Ammo Case \nnow increases ammunition capacity and converts ammo pickups into ammo for the currently equipped weapon after a short delay.\n\n\n\nResearch it in the Tenno Lab or find it in the Market today!\n",

GLYPH is now the catch-all word for Profile Pictures, so you'll see your Glyph selection determine that and your Forum Profile!\nIf you're asking yourself 'Where are my Fusion Cores and what is Endo?\", please read this section carefully! This section explains the conversion from a Fusion Core / Duplicate Mod fusion system to the Endo Fusion system.\nFusion in Warframe is one of the main systems that encourages investment in your Mod collection and Upgrading your gear. With calculated clicking and collecting, you can take your unranked Mods to top tier performers.\nWith the change to an Endo system we've removed the hidden complexity of Fusion. This Endo Fusion system maintains many aspects of the hold.\nWhat is Endo? Endo is Fusion energy incarnate. It is the raw resource that powers the process of Upgrading Mods. In essence, Endo serves as the simplifier in all things Fusion. All duplicate Mods can now be simply converted into Endo. Endo will now drop from enemies and missions where Fusion Cores used to be.\nFusing with Endo makes the Mod Rank increases clear, as the system now only increases in whole Ranks. Partial upgrading with unclear requirements towards your next rank will no longer exist, and neither will wasted Fusion energy. The UI will tell you exactly how much Endo is needed for the next Rank, which gives you a clear goal to work toward.\nAny partial Mod upgrades before this Update will be refunded with equivalent Endo and Credits.\nTreasures: discoverable ancient valuables that can be constructed and converted into high Endo quantities. \nTrading of Endo (in the form of Treasures).\nAdded Rarity colour grading to the Relic Reward selection screen in Fissure missions. \nSoft launch of colourblind door symbols! These new symbols should help you determine if a door is locked or unlocked, as they no longer rely on the sole use of colour. \nAdded a warning message when the last member of an Alliance’s creator Clan tries to dissolve the Clan. \nAdded indicators in the Arsenal of how many Forma are installed in gear, and whether or not gear has been fully Mastered! \nAdded a waypoint marker for Cephalon Fragments. \nAdded more Relic Rewards into Rotation A in replacement of some Credit Bundles and Mods.\n",
  "changes": "The Silver Grove:\nLunaro has been out in the wild for a couple of weeks now, and in this time we've been play testing extensively \ninternally and externally \nand have been listening to your feedback. In an effort to address your concerns and increase the overall playability of the mode we've implemented a number of new gameplay features, arenas, customizations, and back end systems. Read on below for further details:\nNew Conclave weapon skins for the following weapons can now be purchased for standing from Tehsin once you’ve acquired the Typhoon rank:\nHaven't played any Lunaro since launch? Feeling a bit rusty? Well worry no more! The introduction of the new Lunaro Warm-Up system will take players currently waiting in a not full lobby and load them all into a practice session. These sessions will see all active players equipped with their own Lunaro so as to allow everyone the chance to practise basic game mechanics while waiting for additional loadings to join. Once a game is full and ready to begin the match will naturally progress to the proper Lunaro mode with goals, assists, and saves from the previous Warm-Up being wiped clear.\nMuch of the feedback we've received from our seasoned PvP players and newcomers alike was our inscrutable matchmaking rules. We've attempted to stream lines and have separated the rules used to match players in PvE from those used for PvP. Specifics on these PvP specific matchmaking rules are as follows:\nWhen attempting to join a friend you will be placed on their team if there is available space.\nIf you create a squad and then create/join a PvP lobby you will all be placed on the same team. Subsequent joiners will fill the opposing team slots.\nInviting a Friend who is currently in a squad will attempt to being in the full squad into your current game/lobby.\nAttempting to join a PvP match without enough space for you and your squad will now present an error message indicating that there isn't space to accommodate everyone.\nA similar error message to the above will be displayed when a full Squad of 4 players attempts to join a Lunaro match.\nInvite and Friends Only Lobbies now have a \"Switch Team\" option.\nAnother common gripe that has sometimes been affecting our competitive PvP modes was one that affects almost all games of this nature; rage quitters. While any system we introduce won't be able to completely solve this issue we've enacted a consequence system that will hopefully curb some of the more numerous instances:\nWe now track players who quit out of matches including those using the Alt-F4 method.\nThe Penalty system has 2 stages; a warning and a penalty applied state:\nThe warning stage will appear on the Landing Craft after the game detects that you've quit out of a match prematurely.\nThe Penalty Applied state will kick in after a certain % of your last games are determined to have been prematurely left. This state results in an XP Penalty of 75%.\nPlayer's can climb back out of the Penalty Applied state by completing a corresponding amount of full matches.\nWhile also negatively affecting rage quitters, we want to encourage those who continue to play while short on players and those who play multiple matches in a row.\nCompleting a match you were short on will result in a +20% boost to XP and Standing.\nCompleting subsequent matches will results in 10% more XP and Standing after the first match.\nWith the launch of Lunaro on Consoles we introduced full customization options for Lunaro controls. With this update we will be introducing the same functionality for PC keyboard and mouse users.\nHead over to the Options screen to configure your Lunaro bindings as you see fit!\nAnother major complaint directed toward our Conclave game modes has been the potential for laggy experiences due to the game running on our peer to peer system. With this update we will be rolling out the first stages of a potential solution to this issue: volunteer player hosted servers \nwe've got the tools in place to allow you to host Lunaro.\nAt this stage volunteer servers are limited to running Lunaro only, and require a separate dedicated computer to host.\nThe initial roll-out will be conducted via an invite-only process due to the need to gauge scalability and success. We will be using this soft launch to gather valuable feedback and stats and once we determine that the system is ready to provide the best experience we will be moving forward with a full scale public release.\nAffinity gained no longer converts to Energy in Conclave\nIncreased Standing gain at EOM based on Conclave Syndicate Rank\nShield regen delay decreased in Conclave\nShield regen rate

This is affected by Efficiency Mods. \nHealth orbs are no longer guaranteed drops from Desecrated corpses. They are now tied in with the chance for additional loot drops.\nThe number of Shadows spawned has been reduced to 7 and is no longer affected by Mods. This is a necessary change for performance on all platforms. To compensate for this, Nekros now spawns stronger Shadows prioritized by heavy unites killed with Shield multiplier and draw aggro more heavily. \nShadows now live until they die with Health decay over time that is affected by Duration instead of Strength. \nShadows of the Dead can be recast while active to spawn new Shadows to replace dead ones, and refill the Health/Shields of the current Shadows. \n*Recasting Shadows of the Dead will also teleport your Shadows to you within limits. (if they are >10m and <40m away)\nThe Shield of Shadows Augment has been reviewed to maintain efficacy with these changes.\n\nVaulted Relics will now appear in the Codex (ie: Relics that are not currently in circulation that you may own).\nThe Codex section for Relics and Arcanes will now show items you've discovered but don't own (like Mods do so you can see the drop sources to farm some more).\nTweaked the TennoGen Mesa Falcon Helmet tint.\nUpdated the TennoGen Rota Syandana materials.\nIncreased the brightness of the Guides of The Lotus Sigil.\nUpdated the Burston mesh in the Stalker diorama.\n",

With your suggestions and comments in place, we are continuing to tweak Void Fissures/Relics where necessary with the aim to reduce repetition issues and tie this mechanic into the lore of Warframe. The Void is an entity that corrupts, and Void Fissures are no different.\nThere is no longer just one 'Void Fissure', Void Fissures can occur again and again as the Void's corrupting energy tears through the Solar System. Fissures now spawn dynamically throughout the level near groups of enemies. The Fissure will corrupt any nearby enemies immediately after spawning. This buffs the enemy, and resets their health/shields. It will also spawn a couple Orokin units along with them, some being Eximus after a certain amount of Fissures. Fissures despawn after a period of time.\nThe corrupted and newly spawned Orokin units have a chance to drop Reactant, which are auto pickups (no more context action). Once you collect enough, you qualify for the Void Projection reward, and one of your weapons or your Warframe will be buffed for a short period of time based on Era of Void Relic brought. You will be given a random amount of Void Trace as well after collecting enough Reactant. Fissures will continue to spawn throughout the mission.\nVoid Traces cap is now Mastery Rank based (100 + 50 * MR).\nReactant marker now uses the Void Tear icon. The marker is only visible if players don't have enough Reactant.\nReactant uses a drop range (kill x amount for guaranteed drop) instead of drop chance.\n“Endless” Void Fissure missions are now truly endless with the exception of Defense and Interception. \nYour Equipped Relic information will now be shown in the Squad info dropdown box (where Equipped Dragon keys appears).\n*Traces are given when you get 10/10 Reactant (no relic needed) and rewarded at End of Mission (between a range of 6-30).\nFixed an issue with Conclave mods with the Max Energy requirement applying their upgrades twice to the Host.\nReduced melee blocking angle in Conclave.\nReduced channeled blocking energy cost in Conclave.\nAdjusted the attack order of the Spinning Palms Combo in Conclave Fist stance and slightly increased its damage.\nReduced the duration of Equinox's Metamorphosis in Conclave\n",

We've gone over every player ability and augment to provide predictable interactions with Nullifier bubbles and ability immune enemies. Below are the rules that we have adhered by to offer a consistent avenue for players to strategize against foes in-battle.\nAbilities will not affect players or enemies within a Nullifier bubble.\nEffects of an ability on both players and enemies will be removed when entering Nullifier bubbles.\nA Warframe’s active abilities will be deactivated upon entering a Nullifier bubble.\nProjectiles spawned by an ability will be deflected when they encounter a Nullifier bubble. For example, Ember’s Fireball and Ash’s Shuriken will be deflected.\nAbilities that exist independent of their creator will not be deactivated if the Warframe enters a nullifier, but will be destroyed if touched by the bubble itself. For example, Frost’s Snowglobe will not disappear when Frost enters the bubble, but will be destroyed if the bubble comes into contact with the Snowglobe sphere.\nAdjusted the enemy counts for each mission; in most cases the spawn counts were increased.\nImproved enemy tactics to better plan assaults on player-controlled towers; by staging units ahead of time they can be more effective and draw the action to different points around the map.\nChanged how the different types of enemy unit are sent into the fray. Historically you'd see higher-tier units mid-way through the first round and there would be no escalation after that; you should now see more infantry in the first round and then more support and heavy units if you chose to stay to intercept more transmissions.\nTuned the enemy tables to fix the cases where certain levels were 50% enemies that couldn't capture points (eg: Drones).\nCorrupted Vor in T4 Interception will no longer delay the end of round countdown (just the end of round) so that if he's the last enemy you aren't stuck waiting as long.\nFixed the problem where low-level Interception missions were flooded with Eximus’.\nAdded an Interception Mission to Sedna, Berehynia.\nSpoiler\nToxic Ancient's and Ancient Disrupter Auras will no longer stack with multiple Ancients of the same type.\nOberon’s Reckoning has a chance to make enemies drop health orbs which, when grabbed by you, heal your companions which revive them.\nFire rate Pistol mods will now affect Mesa's Peacemaker.\nAdded a PBR pass on materials for a variety of older Grineer and Infested levels.\nMade improvements to the spawn logic for Convergence pickups in Survival and Excavation missions.\nPhobos Tileset is now on Mars, and all Phobos missions are now on Asteroid Tileset.\nIncreased Dark Split-Swords Critical Chance while dual wielding by to 25% and Critical Multiplier to 2.5x.\nSlightly increased the Dark Split Sword dual wield attack speed.\nSlightly decreased the Dark Split Sword Heavy Blade attack speed.\nIncreased the Dark Split Sword Heavy Blade  Element Damage to 90 and Status Chance to 25%\nIncreased the Twin Basolk Status Chance to 40% and increased Elemental damage to 65.\nSlightly Increased Twin Basolk attack speed.\nIncreased Twin Basolk Ground Slam damage by 4x , attack radius to 7.5m, and Status Chance to 65%.\nTwin Basolk Ground Slams can now ragdoll enemies.\nIncreased the amount of Impact damage done with Stradavar automatic fire while decreasing the Puncture and Slash damage these attacks do.\nIncreased the amount of Puncture damage done with Stradavar semi-automatic fire while decreasing the amount of Slash damage these attacks do.\nSlightly decreased the amount of damage done by Stradavar automatic fire and increased the amount of damage done by semi-automatic attacks.\nIncreased the Stradavar Status Chance to 15%.\nPolished the hit detection of melee weapons within Nullifier bubbles. Some weapons, like the Tonbo for example, would strike the Nullifier bubble first, followed by the Nullifier agent in the same strike. However, the damage would only result on the bubble! The weapons can now strike both the bubble and the agent on the same strike, and the agent will take damage as long you are inside the bubble for the attack.\nRemoved in-mission challenges for all Mastery rank tests.\nRemoved two small sections on Nyx Prime that were un-tintable.\nAdjusted the Market icon size of the Akstilleto and Ballistica.\nChanged the way lighting works on Sigils in an attempt tone down excessive bloom.\nSortie Missions can now have more environmental wrinkles, traps, and obstacles within. Stay Alert!\nMade improvements to the animation look and feel of thrown weapons while holding a Datamass.\nAs a result of wanting to reduce the amount of playerbase splitting that the Syndicate Mission rank generation created, we've reduced this to simply have 7 missions per Syndicate.\nAt Rank 1 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 1, 2, 3.\nAt Rank 2 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 2, 3, 4.\nAt Rank 3 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 3, 4, 5.\nAt Rank 4 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 4, 5, 6.\nAt Rank 5 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 5, 6, 7.\nAs a result, now you are more likely play with other members of the Syndicate at close ranks to you. You will still now have 3 Syndicate missions active in your World state menu, but you should now have more people do them with!\nWarframe Helmet blueprints are now labeled as ‘Neuroptics’. Please note that when trading components, full Warframe sets now contain Systems, Chassis, and Neuroptics (previously Helmet) as components.\nPolished a variety of environment materials that were too bright.\nPolished a variety of old tileset decoration placements and layouts.\nPlayers can now choice to cancel an undesired squad migration if the migration is occurring while in a lobby.\nUpdated certain interactable Orokin Derelict consoles with new meshes.\nImproved your Sentinels responsiveness to catching up to you and staying at shoulder level when you're moving quickly.\nRescue targets can now shoot while following players. Teleport actions will still take precedent over this behavior when making your way to extraction.\nReduced the Syndicate buff FX to help aiming visibiltiy as per:\nIncreased the spawn rate of Rare Crates in The Jordas Verdict to match the Law of Retribution.\nThe Archwing ability stat screen will now show the correct range for abilities depending on context. (E.g. Blink used to show 100m, but in space you are 0.25x scale so distances are effectively 4x as far. So in space Blink will now show 400m. In water ranges are reduced, so Blink will show 39.69m.)\nGave Rescue hostages their own (incredibly generous) cover evaluators so their cover findings don't conflict with their behaviour. Gave them larger vision range so they react to dangers behind / next to them and not just when they get shot by them first.\nImproved finisher hit detection for multiple weapons. Reticles will now flash red when a finisher can be performed and with each hit for multistrike finisher moves.\nMultistrike finisher moves will have their damage split amongst each hit instead of now being delivered all at the end.\nPropaganda Drone damage reduction buffs no longer stack.\nImproved jump detection. Before players could prematurely double jump when just about to fall off a ledge, when falling off a small edge, or when walking down a steep incline. Regular jumps will now be performed in these scenarios.\nImproved Dojo and Liset decoration placement code.\nVauban’s Bastille now works on Corpus air units. (Attack Drones, etc.)\nIncreased the drop rate of Automatic Trigger.\nIncreased the drop rate of Vermillion Storm.\nImproved squad merging code to better facilitate Lunaro matchmaking.\nImproved migration code to better handle migrations occurring during PvP team selection phase.\nArchwing augment mods now display an <ARCHWING> tag to help differentiate them.\nImprove the physics on the Ki Teer Syandana.\n\n",

Can be used to Refine Void Relics to yield more rare rewards in your Orbiter.\nReactant: Drops in missions and must be used in the Void Fissure sealing process.\nRefinement: The Process of improving the likelihood of Rare rewards from Void Relics.\nEra: An old Orokin age.\nLith / Meso / Neo / Axi: 4 Distinct Eras of the Orokin past, all suddenly manifesting through Void Fissures in the Solar Map.\nT1 Keys have turned into Lith Era Relics.\nT2 Keys have turned into Meso Era Relics.\nT3 Keys have turned into Neo Era Relics\nT4 Keys have turned into Axi Era Relics.\nVoid Relic Segment: Found on a Junction, used to Refine Void Relics.\nAfter years of new content releases and updated items to collect, there is a certain irony in calling the Void the “void”. Until Specters of the Rail, getting specific Prime parts was a repetitive and regimented process. Each Tower mission has a corresponding key and reward table, and if you want one of those rewards, you need to stock up on the appropriate key and repeat the same mission until you accomplish your goal. That all changes with the introduction of Relics. Instead of running the same mission repeatedly, Relics allow you to dynamically acquire the rewards you want by playing Fissure missions that appear on any planet, and there will always be Void Fissures active. Collecting cool rewards is a fundamental aspect of Warframe, and this new Void system is designed to make it more fun and immersive \nwith Void Fissures ripping into the very fabric of the Origin System!\n*Please note that Void Fissures will not be available for Assassinate and endless mission types \nexcluding Survival \nfor Launch. Further mission support will be coming shortly.\nRead the Developer Workshop here:\nSyndicate Void Key Pack has changed to Relic Pack.\nVoid Key Pack from the Market and Daily Tribute has changed to Relic Pack.\nAs for our good friend Baro, his sales/prices will be monitored closely to take new economy into account in terms of Ducat acquisition.\nAccess to the Derelicts is remaining the same.\nThe Refinement costs for improving an INTACT Void Relic are as follows:\nEXCEPTIONAL = 25 Void Traces\nFLAWLESS = 50 Void Traces\nRADIANT = 100 Void Traces\n\nSpoiler\nThis Update brings a huge change to the way our distance and obstruction sound works across all of Warframe. All distant sounds now feel properly spatialized and obstructed sounds now have the feeling of walls and more. Each shot, each character sound, each infested squeal will now bring you a more visceral and deep sound experience.\nWe updated many weapon sounds to have elements that take advantage of this new sound system.\nArchwing has been upgraded to a full six degrees of freedom! Now, you’ll be able to pilot your Archwing like a true flight simulator with full 360 degree yaws and pitches. (Note: submersible missions will still use the old controls)\nNew Archwing UI and control bindings to further enhance your flying experience!\nNew Eximus Archwing units have been deployed throughout the Origin System!\nSyndicates now offer Archwing components!\nReduced the total number of Archwing nodes to 8 \none of each type for Grineer and Corpus.\nArchwing Pursuit (Saturn \nPandora)\nHunt down a heavily defended Grineer Ship and destroy it by fighting through the ship’s defenses, such as: energy shields, turrets, and mines.\nArchwing Rush (Phobos \nKepler)\nReach hostile supply ships and destroy them before they escape. The more ships you destroy within the given time, the greater the reward.\nGet this Archwing today in the Market or Tenno Clan Research!\nThe Warframe Market got a facelift! Two big motivators behind this rework are pretty straight-forward: a) to make it easier to find what you want and to see what’s available; and b) to allow the Market to grow as more content is added in-game. Highlights of this upgrade include better item categories (especially for Cosmetics) and a brand new search function to help you fine-tune your results. A new hide/show owned button will make browsing for new gear a breeze, but for those who need to save up for the big ticket items, the new Wishlist feature will help you keep track of your must-haves. Feeling particularly generous? You can see your friends’ Wishlists and gift them what their heart desires!\nA large majority of Market-related complaints we receive relate to the confusion between built items (aka Platinum-purchased) and Blueprints. The current Market set-up can misguide players into thinking that Warframes, Weapons, and Sentinels aren’t craftable in-game, so we condensed the Built items and Blueprints into the same page. Information about build costs, stats, blueprint location, and more, will be separated into 3 tabs on this page to help players learn all they need to know about the item in order to make an informed purchase!\n\nWhile trying to make the Market work (and look!) better, we made some pricing changes as follows:\nFrugal Credits Bundle: 50k Credits for 50 Platinum.\nHigh Roller Credit Bundle: 175k Credits for 90 Platinum.\nLoki*: 175 Platinum\nMag*: 75 Platinum\n* These prices were swapped to reflect the change in Starter status.\nSpoiler\nFixed doors locking if a player enters and exits the

  "changes": "Hotfix 18.5.4:\nUpdate 18.5 contained a change made to ensure that enemies will no longer spawn in areas that have been cleared, as long as the level is not on alert.  This change was made to help prevent an exploit that caused enemies to rapidly spawn in the same room only to be instantly killed by stealthed players, and these enemies never scaled.  This was limited mostly to Deception Missions, but was present in Sabotage, Mobile Defense or Spy Missions as well.\nEnemies will now spawn in areas not yet seen by players.  This will allow players to clear rooms stealthily, while avoiding enemies spawning behind players and potentially ruining any stealth runs.  ‘Alerted’ enemies will spawn nearby and out of sight, but can also spawn in rooms already seen by players.\nThese changes will not affect enemy spawning in Exterminate, Excavation, Survival or Defense Missions, but will have a slight impact on enemy spawning on other Mission types.\n•    Loot Crates obtained in the Orokin Moon tileset puzzle rooms will no longer play rare Loot Crate audio FX which mislead players. \n•    Improved the lighting FX displaying on Squad ships seen outside the player’s Landing Craft.\n•    Removed item drops from Mastery Rank 4 survival test.\n•    Removed redundant Empty Relay Instances\n•    Cleaned up Kubrow barks and breathing.\n•    Chat is now enabled in 'Vendor Mode' in Maroo's Bazaar. \n•    The Provoked Mod now affects Inaros's bleed out damage.\n",

Please be conscious that some areas may appear overly or underlit. We will work to fix up any rough looking spots \nfeel free to send screenshots are way in bug threads throughout the appropriate subforums.\nWith Inaros, the sands of old have been swept away from U18 Warframe leaving behind a newer, more vibrant U18.5 Warframe. In many respects, 18.5 is a remastered, more HD version of Warframe with months of technical graphical improvements and artistic relighting of many parts of the game (and more to come in subsequent updates). On top of these changes are across the board rendering performance improvements we hope you'll enjoy, keep in mind that your particular hardware may benefit more and benefit less depending on your GPU, resolution and preferred graphics settings.\nLighting textures have been reengineered to reduce square compression artifacts and ugly color banding. You may have seen me point this out on past Devstreams.         \nAll PBR materials have been recompressed with a more accurate format, new and subtle details are visible on your PBR'd Warframes, gear and in the environment.             \nReflection Probes have been built through many areas of the game, grounding PBR materials with more accurate lighting.        \nCharacter and weapon lighting includes more accurate 'dual specular' lighting which means metallic surfaces are more realistic and fancy looking.      \nHDR rendering has been switched to a compact 32bit format which has improved HDR rendering performance for a wide range of GPUs.               \nTonemapping has been adjusted to use more of the range of lighting content in the game, images have more detail, particularly richer in the darks.        \nMotion Blur and Depth of Field have been re-engineered to run faster and look better, fast moving and defocused objects no longer appear 'cut out' on their silhouettes.          \nDraw order optimizations have been applied to every object in the game, which improves overall performance, particularly in worst-case scenarios.          \nAtmospheric fog effects are now rendering in a separate lighting pass, allowing richer particle effects at distance without being 'erased' by atmosphere.              \nParticle lighting has been improved to more accurately represent the local lighting environment.         \nWind force modelling on many particle systems increase realism as various environmental particles now respond to explosive forces and Warframe powers – you've also probably seen us showcase this in our most recent Devstream.         \nBloom system has been softened and made more seated in the scene. The burnt-out look is replaced with a more subtle and gentle sci-fi glow.         \nPhysics collision, performance and stability have all been improved, as a long-awaited upgrade of Warframe PhysX libraries has been completed.\nInterception AI Improvements\nEnemies in Interception Missions have been overhauled to help improve the flow of combat over the course of the Mission.  These improvements include:\nSuperior objective finding and hacking agent selection.\nBetter player tracking and more intuitive movement to Squad location.\nEnemies unable to hack (such as MOAs) will no longer move to engage hacking consoles.\nConclave Changes & Additions\nRecruit Conditioning has been enabled for all players who are Rank 0-2 with the Conclave Syndicate:\nPlayers who are Rank 0-2 will be matched together in matchmaking.\nEffects from Rare mods are disabled in Recruit matches.\nThis option is turned on by default and can be turned off in the Conclave Liset Console if you want
