  "description": "We‚Äôre back again with our 7th Hotfix since The Old Blood‚Äôs initial release 7 days ago! We have a major improvement in the pipeline to release very soon: Kuva Lich Trading! There are also two issues we are looking to solve in a calculated and better thought-out way to avoid the scenario we created yesterday with fixing a bug. The first issue is making the co-operative aspect of Lich hunting rewarding, and the second is treating the condition of downing your Lich (despite not having the right Requiems) have a different flow in a mission. ¬†Thank you for your patience!",

Ideally after some broader testing we can enable it by default and everyone can benefit.\n\nFixed ground slamming without anyone around as Client counting as a melee strike, which refreshes the Melee Combo Counter.\nFixed Client Initial Combo modifier not working correctly.\nFixed players unable to see Melee slam animation pose for other players.\nFixed Gladiator Mod Set Bonus not applying correctly.\nFixed Weeping Wounds Mod not applying its bonus correctly.\nGrendel can now cast Nourish while Pulverize is active \nto which we‚Äôve added a new sound!\nGrendel Feast expel deals increased damage based on the number and level of enemies.

This system is what the Kingpin system, first shown on Devstream #88, has become over time, despite being put on hold for quite some time! This will continue to be expanded throughout Warframe‚Äôs factions and will be expanded to include a Clan aspect in a future update.\nCIPHER MODS \nThink of these as upgrading the tool aspect of ‚Äòhacking‚Äô.

Your Lich is immortal until you figure out the correct combination of Requiem Mods \nthe precise order matters, and the only way to glean the order is by seeking ‚ÄòRequiem Whispers‚Äô from your Lich‚Äôs Thralls and trying them out on you Lich.\nThe 8 Requiem Mods are:\nLOHK\nFrom brooding gulfs are we beheld\nBy that which bears no name\n\nXATA\nIts heralds are the stars it fells\nThe sky and Earth aflame\n\nJAHU\nCorporeal laws are unwrit\nAs suns and love retreat\nVOME\nTo cosmic madness laws submit\nThough stalwart minds entreat\nRIS\nIn luminous space blackened stars\nThey gaze, accuse, deny\nFASS\nRoiling, moaning, this realm of ours\nIn madness lost shall die\nNETRA\nCarrion hordes trill their profane\nAccord with eldritch plans\nKHRA\nTo cosmic forms from tangent planes\nWe end as we began\nRequiem Relics also contain an all new item \na Riven Sliver! A fragment of a sundered Riven. It is known that, with enough Slivers, Palladino is capable of reforging a complete Riven.\n\n\nThe Void is reacting to the Lich experiments on the Kuva Fortress, and for the first time: Void Fissures are appearing on the Kuva Fortress! But these are unlike the others, and they only respond to REQUIEM RELICS.\nThere are 4 Requiem Relics \neach with 2 Requiem Mods. Collect them all!\n\nYou can get Requiem Relics from KUVA FLOOD SIPHON MISSIONS, guaranteed.\n\nYou can get Requiem Relics from normal KUVA SIPHON MISSIONS, 30% of the time.\n\nThese can be refined like Lith, Meso, Neo, and Axi Relics. A 5th Tab has been added for REQUIEM RELICS in your Void Relic Refinement screen.\nRequiem Mods have a limited amount of charges (3), and¬†consume charges when you successfully kill or convert a Lich. Repeat Requiem Mods in your collection will eventually go to good use.\n\n\nYou can only have one Lich active at a time.\n\nThe only way to get rid of your Lich is by using your Parazon with the correct Requiem Mods in the correct order \nbut you won‚Äôt be able to do this until you‚Äôve found your Lich. Read on to learn how to do that.\n\nClearing Nodes and Killing Thralls leads to progression toward revealing your Lich‚Äôs 3 fatal Requiem Mods.\n\nOnce you know the 3 Mods, figuring out the Order is a matter of trial and error in battles against your Lich \ngood luck!\n\nYour Liches likelihood to hunt you down is indicated by a bar on your Lich menu. The angrier they are, the more likely to spawn. Once you‚Äôve drawn your Lich out to fight by destroying their Thralls and Influence nodes, fights against your LICH can go one of two ways:\nDEFEAT\nif your Parazon does not have the proper order of Requiem Mods. You will be defeated, and your Lich escapes, and grows stronger.\nVICTORY \nif your Parazon does have the proper order of Requiem Mods. You will be victorious.¬†\nTHE VICTORY!\nDefeating your Lich gives you two options:\nConverting your Lich with your Parazon corrupts it and turns it to your side, and will have a chance to appear in battle to aid you.\n\n\nWhen you Vanquish a Lich, you‚Äôll get its Kuva Weapon variant that is completely unique to your Lich. The base weapons are as follows, with custom stats depending on your Lich:\n\n\nIf Kuva Weapons or Lifelong Companionship aren‚Äôt your thing, there‚Äôs more! The birth of a Kuva Lich from a Larvling has a chance to create a Lich with some added flair \none of Seven new Ephemeras that you can only earn from Vanquishing or Converting your Lich (if it has one equipped)! These are a bit more special and rare, so don‚Äôt expect every Lich to have one, but we will be balancing over time.\nBrand new Market items are available to help jump-start your Kuva world domination if that‚Äôs the road you wish to take. As with all our Platinum priced Market goods, these Packs are geared towards attaining convenience, at which they are priced accordingly:\nA Bundle featuring new Mods for your Parazon that give perks to Hacking or performing ‚ÄòMercy‚Äô kills on enemies. Purchased Mods are unranked.\n4 Radiant Requiem Relics, one of each type, I, II, III,and IV.\nGet a taste of the Old Blood with this exclusive, one-time purchase, of Kuva Lich items. Includes a full set of Requiem Mods, the Radiant Requiem Relic Pack, Kuva Warframe Armor, and an assortment of Kuva Lich themed color pallets.\n\n\n\nEach enemy consumed grants 50 bonus Armor.\nSwallow an enemy whole and store it in Grendel‚Äôs gut. Not satisfied? Keep eating, but beware, each foe in Grendel‚Äôs belly slowly consumes Energy. Hold to vomit out stored enemies covering them in toxic bile.\nConsume the enemies in Grendel‚Äôs gut and nourish nearby squad members with a radial buff.\nViolently puke out a bile soaked enemy from Grendel‚Äôs gut, turning the unfortunate creature into a toxic projectile.\nPowered by feasting, Grendel curls into a ball and knocks over anyone in his path. Jumping slams Grendel into the ground and generates a damaging shockwave.\nGrendel can be earned for free through means based on the lore of his Leverian entry. Once you‚Äôve listened, you‚Äôll begin your hunt for Grendel by acquiring:\nGrendel Neuroptics Locator\nGrendel Chassis Locator\nGrendel Systems Locator\nThese Keys are found in Arbitrations and will expose hidden missions on the planet mentioned in his Leverian for you. Grendel helps those in need \nand only those who are truly ‚Äòempty‚Äô will earn his pieces, guaranteed.\n\nDinner is served. An iconic helm for Grendel.\n\n\nA most curious Syandana and one favored by the gallant gourmand, Grendel.\n\n\nTear and chew through enemies with this unusual crankshaft-style greatsword. Grendel's signature weapon.\n*When using Grendel with his signature Masseter, he will be immune from crowd-control procs while doing Heavy Attacks.\n\nIt's all you can eat with this collection for the gallant gourmand. Includes Grendel Warframe, Glutt Helm, Masseter Greatsword, Sumbha Syandana and 3-day Credit and Affinity boosters.\n\nNew Passive: Receive 5% Ability Strength for every enemy within a 50m engulfed in flame (up to a cap).\nWorks fundamentally the same as it does now \ntap for quick fire, hold to charge for greater impact. Enemies already inflicted by any Heat Status effect will now take additional damage.\nFireball has a casting combo, if you use it multiple times rapidly it gets stronger.\nThe damage output and charge speed also scale off of one of Ember‚Äôs newest abilities...\nTime for a history lesson! Prior to Update 11.5, Ember‚Äôs second ability used to be ‚ÄúOverheat‚Äù, offering an aura of heat damage which also protected her from enemy fire. Almost SIX years later, it‚Äôs time for this ring of fire to come full circle.\nWhen cast, Ember Immolates herself with protective fire armor. Her current level of self-Immolation is indicated by a unique UI indicator; the higher the heat, the more damage resistance, and the more effective Ember‚Äôs other abilities become.\nThe Immolation meter will build slowly at first \nusing Ember‚Äôs Fireball or Inferno causes the meter to build faster. But be warned! If the meter reaches maximum, Ember will ‚Äúoverheat‚Äù and Immolation will cost progressively more energy per second the longer you stay in an overheated state. To prevent this from happening, use Fire Blast to expel a portion of your heat meter, or toggle Immolation off to reset meter build.\nCasting time has been greatly reduced, and the ability now strips armor from nearby enemies. The amount of armor removed scales in effectiveness based on current Immolation levels. On cast, this immediately reduces your Immolation level by up to half.\nUpon casting Inferno, all enemies currently within sight are struck by a fiery comet, lighting each target ablaze in a personal ring of fire. Inferno costs Energy per each target in sight, with the cost capped at 10 targets, at which other enemies are then free.\nIf an enemy ignited by Inferno comes in contact with another unit, the fire will spread, igniting them as well with a fresh ability duration. Damage of the heat AoE scales with current Immolation level.\nWith these changes, players will take a more active role in ‚Äúbringing the heat‚Äù to all that stand in their way, with added protection that encapsulates Ember‚Äôs volatile nature.\n\n\nWhen revisiting Vauban, we aimed to retain his status as a crowd control powerhouse, while increasing his mobility and lethality to keep up with 2019 Warframe‚Äôs lightning-quick pace.\nInstead of sticking to surfaces, these new Tesla Drones will roll around, following the player. Once an enemy comes within range, these Drones will latch on and emit a shock that stuns the target and nearby enemies. Each Drone has a limited number of shock charges before it must be replaced. Hold cast to summon multiple Tesla Nervoses at once!\nAll four of his mines have been replaced with new options:\nA deployable beacon marks a location on the map. After a short countdown, the area is struck by a massive orbital laser explosion (and yes, it does work indoors).\nVauban‚Äôs two marquee powers have been combined into a new and devastating ultimate ability!\nWhen deployed, a Bastille will capture nearby enemies, stripping them of their armor over time. Players standing within a Bastille‚Äôs radius will gain a temporary armor increase, building up over time based on how many targets are currently being held in the Bastille.\nWhen a Bastille‚Äôs duration expires, it collapses into a brief Vortex at the center of the cast for easy group kills. Want the Vortex to appear sooner, or last longer? Holding the cast key will collapse all active Bastilles early, or if you have no Bastilles, holding will deploy a new Vortex instead.\nOverall, many of Vauban‚Äôs powers have been streamlined or replaced, making his tools less redundant, and much more versatile for keeping up with the pace of an average Warframe mission.\n*Vauban and Ember have been removed from Conclave in the meantime for balancing.\n\n\nThe trappings of royalty. Includes the deluxe Titania Empress Skin, Hawkmoth Skin for the Dex Pixia exalted weapon, the Mot Skin for the Diwata sword, Titania‚Äôs Heartwood Armor Set and the Dendrite Gunblade Skin.\n\n\nContains Euphrates Pet Armor for both Kubrow and Kavat, modeled on the intimidating, bladed look of the Tigris Shotgun.\n\nIntroducing Vasca! A true child of the night, and a drinker of life.\nBring your Kavat to the Plains of Eidolon at night to meet a Vasca Kavat \nsnoot to snoot. If your Kavat becomes tainted by a Vasca bite, Imprint it and breed 2 together for your own bloodthirsty kitty.\nDon‚Äôt want your Kavat to carry the virus? Visit Master Teasonai in Cetus for the Vasca Curative.\nPLUS, new Vasca Floofs can be acquired by Master Teasonai!\nDon‚Äôt feel like getting in a cat fight? Check out the Market for the Vasca Kavat Starter Kit!\n\n\nIntroducing a new Exilus Weapon Adapter that unlocks an Exilus Weapon Mod Slot for your Primary and Secondary weapons, granting you extra capacity to equip utility Mods. You can find the Exilus Weapon Adapter as an Offering from the main 6 Syndicates, from the new Requiem Relics, or in the in-game Market!\nThese Adapters will be for Primary and Secondary weapons only. Once we have finished making changes to the Melee system, we will re-evaluate the need for a Melee variant.\nThe conversation of tight capacity already exists without the addition of the Exilus Weapon Mod Slot, so we‚Äôre making these Slots default Polarities, meaning all Exilus Weapon Mods are \n(Naramon) or V (Madurai) Polarity.\nIf you‚Äôre familiar with Exilus Mods, they are utility or movement Mods, not sustained DPS grants. Below is a list of eligible Exilus Weapon Mods that sustain the utility intention.

For months Phase 1 has been in your hands, and it‚Äôs time for Phase 2. What follows is a detailed overview of our design direction and intentions with this new Phase.\nWe are not touching Melee Riven Dispositions until we get updated data \nexpect advance notice when we close in on a date for this.\nWe want you to know how your use of melee and feedback on the systems have helped form Phase 2, and how some changes are included to allow for a more cohesive Melee experience. Our tools made Spin attacks optimal at the cost of the more interesting Melee system, and we‚Äôre trying to rectify that overall.\nPreviously we made several changes to the Melee system (as detailed in the Melee Rework Phase 1 Dev Workshop thread) including:\nIntroducing a new quick-melee attack\nFull VFX overhaul on elemental damage types\nAimed Slam Attacks instead of impacting directly below an airborne player.\nWhile select changes are to be rolled back (yes \nsee below before you react), the rest of the system served as a good foundation for this much more expansive Phase 2.\nPlease bear in mind that these changes are not set in stone, and some aspects of the new Melee system will be tweaked during the usual QA process. There are some more features being added later on, introduced in Melee Rework Phase 3 at a later date.\nSo what is covered in Melee Update Phase 2?\nThe Return of Equipped Melee and Manual Blocking!\nDodge Cancelling and Tactical Dodging\n3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Stance Changes, Combos and You!\n4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Smoother Combo Transitions\n5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Combo Counter Rework\n6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Changes to Slam Attacks\n7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Goodbye Channeling, Hello Heavy Attacks and Lifting!\n8.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Weapon Stats, Mastery Limits and General Melee Changes\n9.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mod Rebalancing / Functionality\n10.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Exalted Weapons\n11.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Screens: Arsenal Changes\n12.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Aim Assist\n13.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sticky Fingers when Equipping Melee!\n14.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Channelling 2.0 AKA ‚ÄúRage Mode‚Äù and Future Plans!\nAs you can probably tell, this section is going to be a bit of a lengthy one, so make sure you sit comfortably, drink a nice cup of Greedy Milk and get ready to read all about how you can better turn your enemies into salsa with your favorite melee weapon!\nAn overarching note before you get started, is that every Melee weapon that was originally a single Elemental damage type has been converted to Physical + Element, allowing for more Status reliability as well (Silva and Aegis excluded given Flame Blade).\n\nOne of the bigger changes added to the Melee Rework: Phase 1 was the addition of fluid swapping between melee and Primary / Secondary Weapons. However, some players preferred the ability to manually block, making some of their builds less easy to manage. While we restored manual blocking for players playing ‚Äòsword alone‚Äô, it wasn‚Äôt quite the same.\nThe good news is that both functions are back! Holding the weapon swap button will equip melee fully again, and the aim button will manually block when in this mode. Holding the Weapon Swap button while Exalted Melee is in play will also lock you into Exalted Melee mode! (Don‚Äôt worry, Auto Blocking is still a thing!)\nWe also have redesigned the utility of blocking: Blocking will now prevent 100% of damage,¬† with a blocking angle that is dependent on the melee weapon equipped. All successful Blocks will also add to the new Combo Counter!\n\n\n\nIn the above example, sword and shield weapons (such as the Silva & Aegis) have a blocking angle of 70 degrees, centered on the front of the player, where as a dagger weapon (such as the Dark Dagger) will only have a blocking angle of 45 degrees. (Previously all weapons had a locked blocking angle of 45 degrees upon the introduction of Auto Blocking.)\n\nOne of the older and larger complaints of the melee combo system has been the animation locks. Completing 7 step combos feels great, but the animations completely lock you into the movements. We are introducing two new ways to put more control in your hands:\n\nBy far, the biggest change you will see in the new Melee system is the alterations made to Stances, as well how Combos interact with one another. In the old (current) system, Combos are an effect of button presses, all leading into a chain of animations. In Melee Rework Phase 2, attacks are buttery-smooth and adaptable!\nThis rework of Combos applies to every Stance, not just the weapon types. For example, Tempo Royale (a Heavy Weapon Stance Mod) will still have different Combos than the Cleaving Whirlwind Stance, even though both Stances fit the Heavy Weapon melee type. The difference now, is that both share a design that uses common movements and attack types.\nWe also wanted melee attacks to feel more intuitive. For example, if you are aiming down the sights of a primary weapon or blocking incoming fire, and then hit the melee button, you most likely want to get in close! If you are not inputting a movement key while meleeing, it‚Äôs usually a sign you want to finish off your target. We wanted the new Combos to reflect that that existing movement, and so the new inputs reflect that situational awareness.\nIn most cases, the following improvements can be applied to any given Stance Mod equipped to a weapon (not just individual weapon types!):\nAll of these fresh Stance changes has shone light on Whip Stances in particular not being as desirable in comparison to the others. We‚Äôre aware of this and are working on a new Whip Stance!\n\nIn the old system, only the first follow up attack inputted would remain in ‚Äòmemory‚Äô and would execute at the end of the initial attack animation. Any kind of input entered after the initial follow up was ignored until the next attack had started. In the new system, the next attack is being constantly updated, depending on the last input received.\nThis allows for last-second decisions on combo changes to occur immediately after the first attack has finished. No more waiting for a combo attack animation to end before you can start spamming the attack button again! Embrace the fluidity!\n\nThe Combo Counter will be getting a new functionality pass. Rather than just providing flat bonuses to damage, the Combo Counter will now also act as an expendable resource for new heavy hitting combat: HEAVY ATTACKS! This will replace channeling's key binding, and Section 7 below covers those changes. This counter will be increased in a more granular and rapid way, and can be built by using melee attacks, blocking damage, radial damage from Slam Attacks and hits from a thrown weapon (such as the Glaive).\nAs an expendable resource the Combo Counter should be easy to replenish, and the changes made should reflect how easy you can acquire and spend the Combo Counter resource. In addition, the ‚Äòheaviness‚Äô of an attack will have a measured difference on the amount of Combo Counter it increases. As a general rule, lighter, swift attacks will give lower additions to the Combo Counter than slower, heavy attacks will. Swing for the fences, Tenno!\nCombo Duration is now displayed as a bar underneath your Combo Counter!\n\nThe ragdoll effect of the Slam Attack is being removed (with some weapon-specific exceptions *cough*JatKittag*cough*), however it is being replaced with an effect that will push enemies back or knock them down, giving the player some breathing room, and setting the enemy units up for follow-up attacks.\nMelee Rework: Phase 1 introduced the global use of ragdoll effects on Slam Attacks, so this is the second item to be rolled back, and replaced with a better way to rain down death from above!\nAlso, all Melee weapons have received an updated Slam FX \ncome on and SLAM (attack), and welcome to the jam!\n\nChanneling will be saying its final farewells in the Melee Rework: Phase 2 update, and instead is being replaced with a new form of Heavy Attack, as well as a new Lifted status effect. As we said before, Channeling Mods will also be changed to support this new system, as well as providing a larger pool of utility to choose from in your builds.\nThese are the changes planned:\nBut what about the Channeling FX you ask? Prime Armor Channeling FX will now appear when the Combo Counter reaches 2!\n\nWith this new change, there is a broad-sweeping review of Melee weapons and how they function with the new system:\n\nSince the base damage of melee is being buffed, some notable Mods are getting a balance and/or functionality pass. With the wide amount of changes happening to Channeling and Heavy Attacks, some Mods have had to be reworked into other systems or have had changes to the way their damage scales.\nFor full transparency, some of these are nerfs to specific Mods, but we felt these were necessary to truly allow Phase 2 to be treated as a new beginning for melee. Our intention is to create engaging melee and Modding variety, which is not possible when there is a one-best loadout or single Mod that can kill almost anything in the game. We love killing things effectively, but we also want the combat to be engaging and feel powerful. Spin attacks still exist, but the repetition of them is something we‚Äôre trying not to force you to use. To reiterate: select tools made Spin attacks optimal at the cost of the more interesting Melee system, and we‚Äôre trying to rectify that.\nAt the moment, the current list of Mods and their proposed changes are listed below.\nThis update will also see some changes to the following Weapon, Arcane and Focus School buffs:\nAgain, some of these changes are subject to review and change. Now that Melee Rework: Phase 2 has been rolled out, there will surely be additional balance passes as usability and effectiveness are used (or abused).\n\nAll melee-based Exalted Weapons have received the Phase 2 functionality treatment, gaining access to the combo changes. For those of you who may have missed it, Wukong‚Äôs Exalted Iron Staff has already had this functionality implemented (with the exception of the new Heavy Attacks and changes to the Slam Attacks).\n\nPart of Update 26 involves a change of the Arsenal Screen, and how information is displayed. In the current system, your Arsenal screen looks something like this:\n\n\nIn Update 26, this screen is being reorganized to include Loadouts, Companions and Vehicles in tabs, while also giving more information about a weapon when selected:\n\n\nAs you can see, new stats for Heavy Attacks and Heavy Slam have been added, with channeling statistics removed.\n\nAim assist can be a help or a hindrance depending on what type of attack you wish to perform. While the current system either applies to all or none (on or off), the new system will have more intelligence on aim assist on a per-attack basis. As a general rule under the new system, Aim Assist will be disabled for almost all attacks in the Forward and Tactical Forward Combos, and enabled for most of the Neutral and Tactical Neutral Combo attacks. Of course if you don‚Äôt wish to use aim assist at all, you can disable it from the settings menu as normal.\n\nAnother common issue in user feedback was the unequipping of Gear Items (like the Codex Scanner), or dropping the ‚Äòfootball‚Äô (usually a pickup for Mobile Defense or Sabotage Missions) when equipping melee or using a melee attack. This has now been changed so that you will no longer drop items or unequip Gear Items when either equipping melee or using a Melee Attack!\nThere has been a lot of discussion around this addition, and while it will not be included in the Phase 2 update, there is a lot of work being put into its application. This system is very special and we want to make sure that it is not just a cool addition, but that it has roots in Warframes lore, and a story behind it. This is something we want to implement with a lot of in-game fanfare and details will become available as progress is made.\nFor now, that‚Äôs it!\n\nSome time has passed since our recent Arbitration tweaks \nafter observing stats and listening to your feedback, here are our findings and plans going forward:\n-The initial purpose of the changes, rebalancing the different mission types, was a success! Vitus Essence output is now more consistent across the board when tracking earnings per mission type.\n-We heard your thoughts regarding the droptables, especially the points about Mod drops. We think there is value to having both purchasable offerings as well as luck-based drops, but we can see how these items ‚Äúdiluting‚Äù Endo drops would be a concern.\nWe are addressing this desire for more consistent Endo from two angles:\nDue to the addition of Vitus Essence dropping from Drones, overall Vitus earnings are..... higher than we anticipated. We've decided to leave these values as-is, but will be closely watching the impact Arbitrations has on Kuva economy overall.\n\n\nReduced the number of Kavor Defector squads required for a reward in Defection Arbitration missions to match other mission types.\nReward is now every 2 Defector squads instead of every 4 squads\nAdded a Vitus Essence Decoration to the Arbitration Honors Store.\nTweaked the Vitus pickup FX to be larger and red.\nFixed Vitus pickups sometimes falling through the floor.\nIf you‚Äôve made it to this part of the Update notes, you‚Äôre well aware that a lot of the Warframe meta may shift in new directions. With the current path Catchmoon weapons are on, it was time to bring Catchmoon weapons to a more reasonable power level, while still keeping them effective.\nDecreased fall off damage from 100 to 10.\nDecreased range of projectile from 40m to 20m and fall off range from 20-30m to 8-16m.\nPlease note that we are monitoring item usage for other weapons who use similar projectiles (Fulmin / Arca Plasmor), but will provide notice before we consider changing anything. We are simply monitoring at this phase.\n\nHeat Status procs now reduce targets' armor to 50% of the original value, with subsequent Heat procs refreshing the duration. Not hot enough for you? Applying the Status proc multiple times also turns up the Heat, dealing more damage per tick as the flames increase.\n\nTitania can now Transfer to the Operator during Razorwing.\nTitania‚Äôs cast animations are now an upper body animation only (except Razorwing), alleviating momentum cancelling lower body animations and trimming cast time.\nThorns Tribute now has Damage reflected AND reduced to help our little bug feel a little less squishy.\nTitania can spawn up to four more Razorflies if all Tributes are active, one per Tribute.\nRazorflies can now pick up Tributes.\nEnemies directly affected by Titania‚Äôs Lantern will now have any damage they take dealt to them when the Ability ends (a la Mind Control).\nOur goal with changes to tonemapping is to alleviate fatiguing images by introducing darker midtones. Things may appear more washed out in contrast to how it was before, but don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs all intentional. If you spot things that are out of the ordinary and real wack, please let us know!\n\n\n\n\nThe Options screen, Ayatan Treasures screen, and Dojo Room Options UI have received a fresh new look!\nThe loading screen now puts your Liset at the forefront in a new formation!\nTekko Prime now gains additional Status Chance when used with Atlas and/or Atlas Prime.\nBase status = 10%, Prime = 26%\nEach Kavat can now give you 3 Imprints (up from 2). This will apply to all Kavats that predate this update. If you‚Äôve already used 2, you'll find 1 more ready to go!\nYou can now enter your own Dojo from the Clan screen when visiting someone else's Dojo, instead of having to return to your Orbiter first.\nYou can now double-click on a Dojo Decoration to place it, rather than being required to select a Decoration and hit the Place Decoration button.\nIncreased volume of Lua Rescue Alarm as per player feedback.\nPressing ‚Äòenter‚Äô in the Loadout selection while using the search box will now equip the first Loadout in the resulting grid.\nIncreased the Exposing Harpoon duration from 10 seconds to 15 seconds.\nSwapped the Kuva Bombard Crimson Dervish and 80 Endo drop to Condition Overload.\nAllies will no longer attack Synthesis Targets, thus giving you full control on if you want to Scan.\nWeapon stats will now be reflected in a slightly more rounded way. Innate Damage is added before anything on the weapon happens \nboosting the weapons base Damage and then renormalizes the Damage percentages. This makes Elemental Mods stack in a way you would expect.\nMoved the ‚ÄòTips‚Äô section in the Arsenal Upgrade screens to the button bar at the bottom.\nIncreased the ‚ÄòAdditional Item Drop Chance‚Äô of certain Amalgam enemies from 2% to 4% due to discovery that this drop was broken (fixed below). Happy hunting!¬†\nThe Riven Cycle screen now gives you the option to view the Riven stats on every owned variant of said weapon. For example, I can now select either my normal Lex or my Lex Prime to view it‚Äôs said Stats.\n\n",

Currently, our statistics are looking at the effects of adding Vitus to Drones, reward balance between different mission types, and the overall reward output, comparing Arbitrations both before and after changes.

  "changes": "Arbitrations Revisited: Hotfix 25.7.6:\nLast week we released a Dev Workshop (link on those words: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1128051-arbitrations-revisited-part-2/) outlining our plans to improve Arbitrations, revisiting the droptables and improving reward frequency to be more consistent between modes. From new players who just completed the Star Chart, to veterans returning for new Arcanes and Aura mods, we hope these changes result in a more satisfying gameplay experience overall.\nAll changes are potentially subject to later changes based on feedback, so try out a few mission types and tell us your thoughts!\nIn the original Arbitrations, Excavation missions were the clear outlier in terms of reward output for time spent. The following changes are intended to bring all other missions to the same level as Excavation, and also iterate on other community feedback:\nArbitrations now use regular rotation length for their rewards, with the exception of Excavation. Excavation timers have been adjusted to compensate. Example:\nEX: In lieu of a reward every 10 waves of Defense, you will now receive a reward every 5 waves.\nArbitration rotation cadence has been changed from ‚ÄúABCCCCC...‚Äù to ‚ÄúAABBCCCCC...‚Äù, so that the same level of time investment is encouraged.\nReduced Endo Rewards drop percentage in the drop tables. Rare non-endo reward drop rates are unchanged \nyou‚Äôll just get twice as many chances!\nArbiter Drones will now have a small chance to drop Vitus Essence on kill.\nVitus Essence dropped by destroyed Arbitration drones will have the special pickup notification.\nGhoul Purge inbox messages will no longer automatically open your inbox or play the transmissions if you have completed all of the Encrypted Journal Fragments.¬†\nTweaked weather patterns in the Plains of Eidolon to prevent lengthy rainy periods.¬†\nIncreased brightness of Ash‚Äôs Bladestorm mark slightly to improve visibility.\nAlly NPCs will no longer attack Garuda‚Äôs Blood Atlar Victims.\nUpdated Umbral Forma‚Äôs description to properly reflect the items it can be installed on (Warframes and Melee Weapons). Removed the ability to use Umbral Forma on K-Drives and Archwing Melee.\nTweaks Ostron eyes to make them less glowy.\nLimited Shawzin to 30 notes per second to prevent macros playing ridiculous amounts of notes and causing issues.¬†\nEnemies may now ‚Äúreact‚Äù (without changing their Alert state) to you by stopping and looking around if you shoot a Silent weapon within 2-3m of them several times quickly.¬†\nApplying a Look Link to the same item (ex: a Nova Look Link applied to a Nova) that uses default colours will now properly apply the default color. Previously, the original color would remain unchanged.\nMade micro-optimizations to core math libraries.\n",

This now works properly + and we are working to highlight this fact more (as we work to expose in UI):\nRight clicking on Nightwave rewards will now display its preview diorama.\nFixed inability to mark Mods dropped from containers in the Void for the \"Mark a Resource or Mod\" Nightwave Act.\nFixed the Glaive Prime Blueprint help text saying it's obtainable from Nightwave Cred Offerings.\nWukong‚Äôs Celestial Twin no longer utilizes Quick Thinking to fix the Twin living indefinitely.¬†\nFixed ability to replicate Wukong‚Äôs Celestial Twin multiple times by abusing Emotes.\nFixed Wukong‚Äôs Cloudwalk and Defy abilities turning off sprint toggle when used.\nFixed Wukong‚Äôs Immortality Passive triggering while in Archwing in Vallis / Plains which results in getting stuck in Archwing instead of being knocked out.\nFurther fixes to floating Armor on Wukong / Wukong Prime.\nHistorically the number of concurrent enemies in Survival was related to where the mission was in the Star Chart; early missions tended to have less enemies and later missions tended to have more and this number did not change even when you stayed in a mission longer to face higher-level enemies. As an experiment we have changed the scaling mechanic so that staying in a low-level mission longer will also increase the enemy count as it increases the enemy level until it hits the same cap it would have for high-level missions.\nIncreased visibility of the panic button placed at the Reactor console.\nReduced hack time for enemies at the Reactor panic button to 1.5 seconds.\nIncreased 'Defend' time to 60 seconds from 40 seconds.\nFixed no enemies spawning to trigger lockdown at the Reactor console.\nFixed enemies unable to reach the Reactor console.\nAdded objective text in the UI for maximum clarity for ‚Äòwhat the hek is going on‚Äô.\nRemoved parkour tiles to reduce the chance newer players will get stuck here.\nPossible fix for Zanuka spawning in secret rooms and teleporting players there\nObjective UI markers now flash red to match red X attack markers.\nCorrupted Vor is now marked with a red X marker if killing him is required to progress past the 'kill enemies' stage in Interception.\nChanged Spy panic buttons in the entrance hallways of Spy Vaults to stop enemies using them and setting off the alarm when outside the vault in Gas City, Grineer Fortress, and Sealab tilesets.\nKuva Cell pickups now take priority over Life Support Tower activation actions to alleviate accidental Life Support activation in Kuva Survival. ¬† ¬†\nIncreased brightness of the grey ABC markers in Lua Spy missions.\nImproved an extraction area in the Gas City tileset to be a little more generous.\nChanged the Venus Assassinate area marker so it matches the UI objective.\nRemoved ability to spawn Arlo Devoted Healers in the Simulacrum.\nRemoved Wisp footstep sounds when wall running.\nRemoved outstanding old Corpus Lockers and replaced them with the new Locker meshes.\nImprovements to the Gear Spiral controller sensitivity.\nMade Teleport Pits willing to send loot to a nearby spot as a last resort instead of letting it fall out of the world.\nMade hundreds of micro-optimizations to numerous game and UI scripts.\nMade some micro-optimizations to screenshots taken with F6 (particularly for 4K displays).\nOptimized game startup time slightly.\n",

We will be watching how these changes play out as we plan to iterate further on the mode in the future, with our next review for Arbitrations focusing on reward pacing.\nIn order to revive a player, 5 of these Resurgence Burdens must be taken to their tower simultaneously. These 5 pickups can be delivered by one or multiple squadmates, but cannot be ‚Äúdropped off‚Äù at the tower \nit‚Äôs all or nothing!\nA similar Emote style to the TennoCon 2019 Emote, the Illumina Judicium displays your true dedication to Arbitrations with a looping Vitus Illumina Glyph whilst doing an angsty Meditation pose.\nAlso, a new Arbitrations reward has been added:¬†the elusive Aura Forma Blueprint! Craft an Aura Forma to modify an Aura slot on a Warframe to be compatible with any Mod Polarity.\nRemoved custom enemy level scaling from Defense, Survival, Interception, Excavation, Defection, and Infested Salvage modes in Arbitrations.

  "changes": "Upon picking up a Datamass, a Melee to gun swap will automatically equip your Secondary weapon instead of your Primary weapon, which would make you drop the Datamass.\nPressing F when in Melee mode now switches you back to your \"other\" weapon. For example, if your Primary weapon is equipped when you trigger a Melee attack, you will return to your Primary weapon when you aim or fire. If you instead press F while in Melee mode, you will now equip your Secondary weapon.\nFixed a case where you could be left in an UNARMED state after using a non-Melee Exalted weapon (like Hildryn's Balefire) and went back to Melee when you had no other weapons in your loadout, having gone Melee only to that mission.\nFixed the Operator's Vazarin Guardian Shell not manifesting the charged Void Blast shield.\nFixed an issue where auto-blocking could cancel the charged/heavy Melee attacks.\nImplemented fixes toward briefly being unable to Melee after an Aerial Attack, which breaks the flow of battle.\nFixed being able to Quick Melee when you equip an Archgun with either a Primary or Secondary equipped before that.\nFixed the Melee-only Parry becoming a toggle that you can't release until you attack for Clients.\nFixes towards the Wise Razor Stance giving unintended extreme velocity.

We're starting with this cost because many abilities of this nature have movement restrictions that can be overcome with Augments (Peacemaker, Resonating Quake, Assimilate). We want to try out a movement cost before we tweak further based on feedback.¬†\nRemoved additional sound for Hildryn's Haven ability based on feedback.\nRemoved ability to access Gear/Emote/Hotkeys when Hildryn is in Aegis Storm due to it breaking functionality.¬†\nFixed Clients seeing incorrect animation when observing a Host Hildryn in her Aegis Storm ability.\n1) We have Restored Arcanes not triggering from Exalted weapons across the board by reverting the change made in Update 24.4.0:\nDispatch Overdrive now applies to Garuda‚Äôs Talons when equipped.\nBalance is a conversation that we constantly have, and we see you having as well. For some people the answer is don't nerf things, buff everything else. This is the path of least resistance for us, as most of the player base is happy when we buff, and angry when we nerf. However this has a few side effects that impact the game as a whole. First, with more damage, the time to kill on enemies is lowered and the value of Crowd Control declines even more (Vauban?!). Higher max damage also means that players with the latest bells and whistles can easily kill bosses in an instant, and overcome any challenge with ease. The more your play, the easier the game gets!\nSo far we have been kicking the can down the road, accepting power creep and its consequences on the game \nand often this game is a 'kill all the things' based game. We've mostly done nerfs on things that could be automated, required no player interaction or removed options from the game by making all other choices bad. We will continue to wrestle with this, but the most important part is when and if we decide major balance changes are needed, we will let you know and it will be the result of a lot of consideration. Design changes like this need to be more tempered and considered.\nThanks for hanging in there through all this confusion. Six years in and we are still learning how to do this.\nK-Drive Race Standing has been doubled!\nStanding gained per Gate is now 200\nMax Standing gained per Race is now 6000\nCoolant Raknoids now pop their backs on death \ndelicious!¬†\nThe Trading screen now contains a Riven category and specific search functionality!\nRemoved an unintended projectile launch on the 2nd charge attack of the Tatsu.

If you hadn‚Äôt guessed it already, Carrier usage represents almost 80% of the total used Sentinels, and considering we have more than 5 unique choices this needed balancing. Today we're eager to introduce a community driven experiment within the Sentinel class. This is not the final book in this conversation, just the beginning.\nWe've also mentioned Kubrow/Kavat are not off the table. What we want to do is measure. We know where Carrier sits in usage compared to the rest of the options. We want a calculated release of a change that will deliver on giving Sentinels the function of Vacuum, and see how it affects the usage of content in that category. The results are something we'll be sharing as it should be very interesting to everyone invested in this particular topic. The shovel in the ground on this will apply to Sentinels first, but Pets aren't off the table.\nWe're starting with Sentinels to have this contained group of content analyzed. We will be keeping a close eye on how all of you feel about the new vacuum as well as looking at metrics to see how the distribution of sentinel usage changes across the community (right now 80% of you use Carrier)! We will share results along the way as a team, as soon as this Friday on Devstream #81!\nCarrier‚Äôs precept has been automatically changed to Ammo Case \nnow increases ammunition capacity and converts ammo pickups into ammo for the currently equipped weapon after a short delay.\n\n\n\nResearch it in the Tenno Lab or find it in the Market today!\n",

This section explains the conversion from a Fusion Core / Duplicate Mod fusion system to the Endo Fusion system.\nFusion in Warframe is one of the main systems that encourages investment in your Mod collection and Upgrading your gear. With calculated clicking and collecting, you can take your unranked Mods to top tier performers.\nWith the change to an Endo system we've removed the hidden complexity of Fusion. This Endo Fusion system maintains many aspects of the hold.\nWhat is Endo? Endo is Fusion energy incarnate. It is the raw resource that powers the process of Upgrading Mods. In essence, Endo serves as the simplifier in all things Fusion. All duplicate Mods can now be simply converted into Endo. Endo will now drop from enemies and missions where Fusion Cores used to be.\nFusing with Endo makes the Mod Rank increases clear, as the system now only increases in whole Ranks. Partial upgrading with unclear requirements towards your next rank will no longer exist, and neither will wasted Fusion energy. The UI will tell you exactly how much Endo is needed for the next Rank, which gives you a clear goal to work toward.\nAny partial Mod upgrades before this Update will be refunded with equivalent Endo and Credits.\nTreasures: discoverable ancient valuables that can be constructed and converted into high Endo quantities.¬†\nTrading of Endo (in the form of Treasures).\nAdded Rarity colour grading to the Relic Reward selection screen in Fissure missions.¬†\nSoft launch of colourblind door symbols!

  "changes": "The Silver Grove:\nLunaro has been out in the wild for a couple of weeks now, and in this time we've been play testing extensively \ninternally and externally \nand have been listening to your feedback. In an effort to address your concerns and increase the overall playability of the mode we've implemented a number of new gameplay features, arenas, customizations, and back end systems. Read on below for further details:\nNew Conclave weapon skins for the following weapons can now be purchased for standing from Tehsin once you‚Äôve acquired the Typhoon rank:\nHaven't played any Lunaro since launch? Feeling a bit rusty? Well worry no more! The introduction of the new Lunaro Warm-Up system will take players currently waiting in a not full lobby and load them all into a practice session. These sessions will see all active players equipped with their own Lunaro so as to allow everyone the chance to practise basic game mechanics while waiting for additional loadings to join. Once a game is full and ready to begin the match will naturally progress to the proper Lunaro mode with goals, assists, and saves from the previous Warm-Up being wiped clear.\nMuch of the feedback we've received from our seasoned PvP players and newcomers alike was our inscrutable matchmaking rules. We've attempted to stream lines and have separated the rules used to match players in PvE from those used for PvP. Specifics on these PvP specific matchmaking rules are as follows:\nWhen attempting to join a friend you will be placed on their team if there is available space.\nIf you create a squad and then create/join a PvP lobby you will all be placed on the same team. Subsequent joiners will fill the opposing team slots.\nInviting a Friend who is currently in a squad will attempt to being in the full squad into your current game/lobby.\nAttempting to join a PvP match without enough space for you and your squad will now present an error message indicating that there isn't space to accommodate everyone.\nA similar error message to the above will be displayed when a full Squad of 4 players attempts to join a Lunaro match.\nInvite and Friends Only Lobbies now have a \"Switch Team\" option.\nAnother common gripe that has sometimes been affecting our competitive PvP modes was one that affects almost all games of this nature; rage quitters. While any system we introduce won't be able to completely solve this issue we've enacted a consequence system that will hopefully curb some of the more numerous instances:\nWe now track players who quit out of matches including those using the Alt-F4 method.\nThe Penalty system has 2 stages; a warning and a penalty applied state:\nThe warning stage will appear on the Landing Craft after the game detects that you've quit out of a match prematurely.\nThe Penalty Applied state will kick in after a certain % of your last games are determined to have been prematurely left. This state results in an XP Penalty of 75%.\nPlayer's can climb back out of the Penalty Applied state by completing a corresponding amount of full matches.\nWhile also negatively affecting rage quitters, we want to encourage those who continue to play while short on players and those who play multiple matches in a row.\nCompleting a match you were short on will result in a +20% boost to XP and Standing.\nCompleting subsequent matches will results in 10% more XP and Standing after the first match.\nWith the launch of Lunaro on Consoles we introduced full customization options for Lunaro controls. With this update we will be introducing the same functionality for PC keyboard and mouse users.\nHead over to the Options screen to configure your Lunaro bindings as you see fit!\nAnother major complaint directed toward our Conclave game modes has been the potential for laggy experiences due to the game running on our peer to peer system. With this update we will be rolling out the first stages of a potential solution to this issue: volunteer player hosted servers \nwe've got the tools in place to allow you to host Lunaro.\nAt this stage volunteer servers are limited to running Lunaro only, and require a separate dedicated computer to host.\nThe initial roll-out will be conducted via an invite-only process due to the need to gauge scalability and success. We will be using this soft launch to gather valuable feedback and stats and once we determine that the system is ready to provide the best experience we will be moving forward with a full scale public release.\nAffinity gained no longer converts to Energy in Conclave\nIncreased Standing gain at EOM based on Conclave Syndicate Rank\nShield regen delay decreased in Conclave\nShield regen rate

They are now tied in with the chance for additional loot drops.\nThe number of Shadows spawned has been reduced to 7 and is no longer affected by Mods. This is a necessary change for performance on all platforms. To compensate for this, Nekros now spawns stronger Shadows prioritized by heavy unites killed with Shield multiplier and draw aggro more heavily.¬†\nShadows now live until they die with Health decay over time that is affected by Duration instead of Strength.¬†\nShadows of the Dead can be recast while active to spawn new Shadows to replace dead ones, and refill the Health/Shields of the current Shadows.¬†\n*Recasting Shadows of the Dead will also teleport your Shadows to you within limits. (if they are >10m and <40m away)\nThe Shield of Shadows Augment has been reviewed to maintain efficacy with these changes.\n\nVaulted Relics will now appear in the Codex (ie: Relics that are not currently in circulation that you may own).\nThe Codex section for Relics and Arcanes will now show items you've discovered but don't own (like Mods do so you can see the drop sources to farm some more).\nTweaked the TennoGen Mesa Falcon Helmet tint.\nUpdated the TennoGen Rota Syandana materials.\nIncreased the brightness of the Guides of The Lotus Sigil.\nUpdated the Burston mesh in the Stalker diorama.\n",

With your suggestions and comments in place, we are continuing to tweak Void Fissures/Relics where necessary with the aim to reduce repetition issues and tie this mechanic into the lore of Warframe. The Void is an entity that corrupts, and Void Fissures are no different.\nThere is no longer just one 'Void Fissure', Void Fissures can occur again and again as the Void's corrupting energy tears through the Solar System. Fissures now spawn dynamically throughout the level near groups of enemies. The Fissure will corrupt any nearby enemies immediately after spawning. This buffs the enemy, and resets their health/shields. It will also spawn a couple Orokin units along with them, some being Eximus after a certain amount of Fissures. Fissures despawn after a period of time.\nThe corrupted and newly spawned Orokin units have a chance to drop Reactant, which are auto pickups (no more context action). Once you collect enough, you qualify for the Void Projection reward, and one of your weapons or your Warframe will be buffed for a short period of time based on Era of Void Relic brought. You will be given a random amount of Void Trace as well after collecting enough Reactant. Fissures will continue to spawn throughout the mission.\nVoid Traces cap is now Mastery Rank based (100 + 50 * MR).\nReactant marker now uses the Void Tear icon. The marker is only visible if players don't have enough Reactant.\nReactant uses a drop range (kill x amount for guaranteed drop) instead of drop chance.\n‚ÄúEndless‚Äù Void Fissure missions are now truly endless with the exception of Defense and Interception.¬†\nYour Equipped Relic information will now be shown in the Squad info dropdown box (where Equipped Dragon keys appears).\n*Traces are given when you get 10/10 Reactant (no relic needed) and rewarded at End of Mission (between a range of 6-30).\nFixed an issue with Conclave mods with the Max Energy requirement applying their upgrades twice to the Host.\nReduced melee blocking angle in Conclave.\nReduced channeled blocking energy cost in Conclave.\nAdjusted the attack order of the Spinning Palms Combo in Conclave Fist stance and slightly increased its damage.\nReduced the duration of Equinox's Metamorphosis in Conclave\n",

  "additions": "Your Arsenal will now display the corresponding skin icon when equipped rather than the underlying Warframe.\nCompletely revisited old tilesets and added new rare loot spawn points for Syndicate Medallions and more. This should also fix issues with some missions only having 3 or so Syndicate Medallions to collect.\nThe Alert generator has had some trimming done with the removal of Void Keys and some Credit Alerts which ultimately reduces the time it takes to complete an Alert Cycle from approximately 15 days to approximately 10 days.

We've gone over every player ability and augment to provide predictable interactions with Nullifier bubbles and ability immune enemies. Below are the rules that we have adhered by to offer a consistent avenue for players to strategize against foes in-battle.\nAbilities will not affect players or enemies within a Nullifier bubble.\nEffects of an ability on both players and enemies will be removed when entering Nullifier bubbles.\nA Warframe‚Äôs active abilities will be deactivated upon entering a Nullifier bubble.\nProjectiles spawned by an ability will be deflected when they encounter a Nullifier bubble. For example, Ember‚Äôs Fireball and Ash‚Äôs Shuriken will be deflected.\nAbilities that exist independent of their creator will not be deactivated if the Warframe enters a nullifier, but will be destroyed if touched by the bubble itself. For example, Frost‚Äôs Snowglobe will not disappear when Frost enters the bubble, but will be destroyed if the bubble comes into contact with the Snowglobe sphere.\nAdjusted the enemy counts for each mission; in most cases the spawn counts were increased.\nImproved enemy tactics to better plan assaults on player-controlled towers; by staging units ahead of time they can be more effective and draw the action to different points around the map.\nChanged how the different types of enemy unit are sent into the fray. Historically you'd see higher-tier units mid-way through the first round and there would be no escalation after that; you should now see more infantry in the first round and then more support and heavy units if you chose to stay to intercept more transmissions.\nTuned the enemy tables to fix the cases where certain levels were 50% enemies that couldn't capture points (eg: Drones).\nCorrupted Vor in T4 Interception will no longer delay the end of round countdown (just the end of round) so that if he's the last enemy you aren't stuck waiting as long.\nFixed the problem where low-level Interception missions were flooded with Eximus‚Äô.\nAdded an Interception Mission to Sedna, Berehynia.\nSpoiler\nToxic Ancient's and Ancient Disrupter Auras will no longer stack with multiple Ancients of the same type.\nOberon‚Äôs Reckoning has a chance to make enemies drop health orbs which, when grabbed by you, heal your companions which revive them.\nFire rate Pistol mods will now affect Mesa's Peacemaker.\nAdded a PBR pass on materials for a variety of older Grineer and Infested levels.\nMade improvements to the spawn logic for Convergence pickups in Survival and Excavation missions.\nPhobos Tileset is now on Mars, and all Phobos missions are now on Asteroid Tileset.\nIncreased Dark Split-Swords Critical Chance while dual wielding by to 25% and Critical Multiplier to 2.5x.\nSlightly increased the Dark Split Sword dual wield attack speed.\nSlightly decreased the Dark Split Sword Heavy Blade attack speed.\nIncreased the Dark Split Sword Heavy Blade ¬†Element Damage to 90 and Status Chance to 25%\nIncreased the Twin Basolk Status Chance to 40% and increased Elemental damage to 65.\nSlightly Increased Twin Basolk attack speed.\nIncreased Twin Basolk Ground Slam damage by 4x , attack radius to 7.5m, and Status Chance to 65%.\nTwin Basolk Ground Slams can now ragdoll enemies.\nIncreased the amount of Impact damage done with Stradavar automatic fire while decreasing the Puncture and Slash damage these attacks do.\nIncreased the amount of Puncture damage done with Stradavar semi-automatic fire while decreasing the amount of Slash damage these attacks do.\nSlightly decreased the amount of damage done by Stradavar automatic fire and increased the amount of damage done by semi-automatic attacks.\nIncreased the Stradavar Status Chance to 15%.\nPolished the hit detection of melee weapons within Nullifier bubbles. Some weapons, like the Tonbo for example, would strike the Nullifier bubble first, followed by the Nullifier agent in the same strike. However, the damage would only result on the bubble! The weapons can now strike both the bubble and the agent on the same strike, and the agent will take damage as long you are inside the bubble for the attack.\nRemoved in-mission challenges for all Mastery rank tests.\nRemoved two small sections on Nyx Prime that were un-tintable.\nAdjusted the Market icon size of the Akstilleto and Ballistica.\nChanged the way lighting works on Sigils in an attempt tone down excessive bloom.\nSortie Missions can now have more environmental wrinkles, traps, and obstacles within. Stay Alert!\nMade improvements to the animation look and feel of thrown weapons while holding a Datamass.\nAs a result of wanting to reduce the amount of playerbase splitting that the Syndicate Mission rank generation created, we've reduced this to simply have 7 missions per Syndicate.\nAt Rank 1 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 1, 2, 3.\nAt Rank 2 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 2, 3, 4.\nAt Rank 3 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 3, 4, 5.\nAt Rank 4 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 4, 5, 6.\nAt Rank 5 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 5, 6, 7.\nAs a result, now you are more likely play with other members of the Syndicate at close ranks to you. You will still now have 3 Syndicate missions active in your World state menu, but you should now have more people do them with!\nWarframe Helmet blueprints are now labeled as ‚ÄòNeuroptics‚Äô. Please note that when trading components, full Warframe sets now contain Systems, Chassis, and Neuroptics (previously Helmet) as components.\nPolished a variety of environment materials that were too bright.\nPolished a variety of old tileset decoration placements and layouts.\nPlayers can now choice to cancel an undesired squad migration if the migration is occurring while in a lobby.\nUpdated certain interactable Orokin Derelict consoles with new meshes.\nImproved your Sentinels responsiveness to catching up to you and staying at shoulder level when you're moving quickly.\nRescue targets can now shoot while following players. Teleport actions will still take precedent over this behavior when making your way to extraction.\nReduced the Syndicate buff FX to help aiming visibiltiy as per:\nIncreased the spawn rate of Rare Crates in The Jordas Verdict to match the Law of Retribution.\nThe Archwing ability stat screen will now show the correct range for abilities depending on context. (E.g. Blink used to show 100m, but in space you are 0.25x scale so distances are effectively 4x as far. So in space Blink will now show 400m. In water ranges are reduced, so Blink will show 39.69m.)\nGave Rescue hostages their own (incredibly generous) cover evaluators so their cover findings don't conflict with their behaviour. Gave them larger vision range so they react to dangers behind / next to them and not just when they get shot by them first.\nImproved finisher hit detection for multiple weapons. Reticles will now flash red when a finisher can be performed and with each hit for multistrike finisher moves.\nMultistrike finisher moves will have their damage split amongst each hit instead of now being delivered all at the end.\nPropaganda Drone damage reduction buffs no longer stack.\nImproved jump detection. Before players could prematurely double jump when just about to fall off a ledge, when falling off a small edge, or when walking down a steep incline. Regular jumps will now be performed in these scenarios.\nImproved Dojo and Liset decoration placement code.\nVauban‚Äôs Bastille now works on Corpus air units. (Attack Drones, etc.)\nIncreased the drop rate of Automatic Trigger.\nIncreased the drop rate of Vermillion Storm.\nImproved squad merging code to better facilitate Lunaro matchmaking.\nImproved migration code to better handle migrations occurring during PvP team selection phase.\nArchwing augment mods now display an <ARCHWING> tag to help differentiate them.\nImprove the physics on the Ki Teer Syandana.\n\n",
  "fixes": "\n\nSpecters of the Rail ‚Äì changes to the Origin System are here, Tenno. What ghosts lurk the chambers of abandoned Junctions of a past era?\nFind a new way to experience the Origin System with the complete rework of the Star Chart.\n¬†\nThis redesign of the original Star Chart will bring back the nostalgic roadmap design making it easier for you to travel the Origin System. The map is dynamic; zoom in and out and drag your way around the Origin System. Specific regions and missions will be easier to locate. Also, it will be clear to see which Missions you need to complete thanks to new Junctions -\nroutes between planets -\nguiding you on where to go next.\n¬†\nWe've replaced and re-assigned many missions, including the removal of Deception and the not-so-popular Archwing Defense.\n¬†\nDifficulty, planet progression, and enemy levels have been reassigned to better reflect the modern Solar System.\n¬†\nDedicated memorials have been set up in Relays to display the names of contributing Founders!\n\nSpecters of the Rail live here \nyou must show you are worthy to conquer the Junction and ignite its Planetary travel power.\nJunctions link travel \nall players new and old must complete the Task list to activate the Junctions for progression and rewards.\nJunctions reward players with Mastery upon completion! Please note this Mastery reward is quite large, and offsets any Mastery points lost in the Star Chart changes of nodes per planet.\nVenus\nMercury Junction: Once Awake, Howl of the Kubrow\nEarth\nMars Junction: The Archwing\nMars\nPhobos Junction: Stolen Dreams\nJupiter\nEuropa Junction: The New Strange, Limbo Theorem Blueprint\nSaturn\nUranus Junction: Natah, Clem Quest\nUranus\nNeptune Junction: The Second Dream\nPluto\nSedna Junction: Hidden Messages Blueprint\nPluto\nEris Junction: Patient Zero Blueprint, The Jordas Precept Blueprint\n*Sands of Inaros Blueprint is still obtained from Baro Ki Teer.\n\nVoid Relic: Ancient Relics that react to Void Fissures to reveal treasures within.\nVoid Traces: Raw Void energy that drops in the process of uniting Relics and Fissures. Can be used to Refine Void Relics to yield more rare rewards in your Orbiter.\nReactant: Drops in missions and must be used in the Void Fissure sealing process.\nRefinement: The Process of improving the likelihood of Rare rewards from Void Relics.\nEra: An old Orokin age.\nLith / Meso / Neo / Axi: 4 Distinct Eras of the Orokin past, all suddenly manifesting through Void Fissures in the Solar Map.\nT1 Keys have turned into Lith Era Relics.\nT2 Keys have turned into Meso Era Relics.\nT3 Keys have turned into Neo Era Relics\nT4 Keys have turned into Axi Era Relics.\nVoid Relic Segment: Found on a Junction, used to Refine Void Relics.\nAfter years of new content releases and updated items to collect, there is a certain irony in calling the Void the ‚Äúvoid‚Äù. Until Specters of the Rail, getting specific Prime parts was a repetitive and regimented process. Each Tower mission has a corresponding key and reward table, and if you want one of those rewards, you need to stock up on the appropriate key and repeat the same mission until you accomplish your goal. That all changes with the introduction of Relics. Instead of running the same mission repeatedly, Relics allow you to dynamically acquire the rewards you want by playing Fissure¬†missions that appear on any planet, and there will always be Void Fissures active. Collecting cool rewards is a fundamental aspect of Warframe, and this new Void system is designed to make it more fun and immersive \nwith Void Fissures ripping into the very fabric of the Origin System!\n*Please note that Void Fissures will not be available for Assassinate and endless mission types \nexcluding Survival \nfor Launch. Further mission support will be coming shortly.\nRead the Developer Workshop here:\nSyndicate Void Key Pack has changed to Relic Pack.\nVoid Key Pack from the Market and Daily Tribute has changed to Relic Pack.\nAs for our good friend Baro, his sales/prices will be monitored closely to take new economy into account in terms of Ducat acquisition.\nAccess to the Derelicts is remaining the same.\nThe Refinement costs for improving an INTACT Void Relic are as follows:\nEXCEPTIONAL = 25 Void Traces\nFLAWLESS = 50 Void Traces\nRADIANT = 100 Void Traces\n\nSpoiler\nThis Update brings a huge change to the way our distance and obstruction sound works across all of Warframe. All distant sounds now feel properly spatialized and obstructed sounds now have the feeling of walls and more. Each shot, each character sound, each infested squeal will now bring you a more visceral and deep sound experience.\nWe updated many weapon sounds to have elements that take advantage of this new sound system.\nArchwing has been upgraded to a full six degrees of freedom! Now, you‚Äôll be able to pilot your Archwing like a true flight simulator with full 360 degree yaws and pitches. (Note: submersible missions will still use the old controls)\nNew Archwing UI and control bindings to further enhance your flying experience!\nNew Eximus Archwing units have been deployed throughout the Origin System!\nSyndicates now offer Archwing components!\nReduced the total number of Archwing nodes to 8 \none of each type for Grineer and Corpus.\nArchwing Pursuit (Saturn \nPandora)\nHunt down a heavily defended Grineer Ship and destroy it by fighting through the ship‚Äôs defenses, such as: energy shields, turrets, and mines.\nArchwing Rush (Phobos \nKepler)\nReach hostile supply ships and destroy them before they escape. The more ships you destroy within the given time, the greater the reward.\nGet this Archwing today in the Market or Tenno Clan Research!\nThe Warframe Market got a facelift! Two big motivators behind this rework are pretty straight-forward: a) to make it easier to find what you want and to see what‚Äôs available; and b) to allow the Market to grow as more content is added in-game. Highlights of this upgrade include better item categories (especially for Cosmetics) and a brand new search function to help you fine-tune your results. A new hide/show owned button will make browsing for new gear a breeze, but for those who need to save up for the big ticket items, the new Wishlist feature will help you keep track of your must-haves. Feeling particularly generous? You can see your friends‚Äô Wishlists and gift them what their heart desires!\nA large majority of Market-related complaints we receive relate to the confusion between built items (aka Platinum-purchased) and Blueprints. The current Market set-up can misguide players into thinking that Warframes, Weapons, and Sentinels aren‚Äôt craftable in-game, so we condensed the Built items and Blueprints into the same page. Information about build costs, stats, blueprint location, and more, will be separated into 3 tabs on this page to help players learn all they need to know about the item in order to make an informed purchase!\n\nWhile trying to make the Market work (and look!) better, we made some pricing changes as follows:\nFrugal Credits Bundle: 50k Credits for 50 Platinum.\nHigh Roller Credit Bundle: 175k Credits for 90 Platinum.\nLoki*: 175 Platinum\nMag*: 75 Platinum\n* These prices were swapped to reflect the change in Starter status.\nSpoiler\nFixed doors locking if a player enters and exits the door while the buttons are held in Stage 3 of The Law of Retribution.\nFixed a variety of weapons having improper Arsenal information on their noise type: Silent or Alarming.\nFixed missing sounds

of enemy behaviour issues that could affect game performance.\nFixed issues with poor performance when returning to your Landing Craft from missions.\nFixed an issue with 'Damaged' faction-specific

  "fixes": "Hotfix 18.13.2\n\n\n\nWe've received word from the Lotus that everyone will have 7 days following the launch of 18.13.2 to claim a free Forma via inbox simply by logging in shortly after we launch.\n\n\n\nWith the power of all your Draco runs, we have intercepted this message:\n\nYou have fought long and hard for our cause \nlearning to master many Warframes and Weapons in your Arsenal. Take this gift of Forma as a token of my appreciation for your willingness to bend the will of your equipment to suit your needs on the battlefield.\n\nThe Lotus.\n\n\n\nTrinity Changes & Fixes\n\nBlessing: Damage Resistance is no longer calculated based on an Average, but instead a flat value simply capped at 75% (which can be achieved via use of Strength mods). The squad UI now shows who is in range with the Tenno Affinity marker.\nFixed Trinity‚Äôs Blessing dealing a possible infinite damage multiplier.\nValkyr Changes:\n\nHysteria: Each kill reduces her Hysteria Aura by 1 meter, the aura will continue to grow but killing frequently will keep it tight around you so you can control its range.\nMag Changes & Fixes\n\nImproved the FX of Mag‚Äôs Polarize.\nFixed Mag‚Äôs Crush FX not playing properly for Clients. \nFixed Mag‚Äôs Magnetize bubble being invisible when inside it.\nFixed Mag dealing self-damage with Magnetize.\nEnemy Plasma Grenade Changes\n\nBefore Plasma Grenades explode, they will live for 3 seconds after coming to a rest on the ground.\nPlasma Grenades can now be shot in air or when they are on the ground. \nWhen an enemy Plasma Grenade is shot and killed, it will explode and damage any enemies in range with no damage to you. A Tenno with a keen ear will be able to identify these threats and counter them with an accurate shot before it's too late.\nEnemy Changes & Fixes\n\nBallistas will have telegraphing when they are winding up to fire off a round from their deadly Vulkars. An observant Tenno will be better able to identify and prioritize these threats.\nHyekka Masters: Fixed the Hyekka Master‚Äôs Ignis dealing damage through walls.\n\n\nPlease see our Developer Workshop Part 4 for more information: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/654868-dev-workshop-part-4-hotfix-18132-information-more/\n\n\n\nStarting Mod Capacity Changes:\n\nThe starting Mod Capacity for your gear (new or Forma'd) is now determined by your Mastery Rank and if an item has an Orokin Reactor or Catalyst installed.\n\nFor example, a Mastery 20 player would experience the following:\n\nClaim a new Warframe from the Foundry with no Reactor installed.\nObserve the 'Unranked' item and see the starting Mod capacity is 20. \nInstall a Reactor, observe the Mod capacity has doubled to 40.\nThe formula is:\n\nStarting Mod Capacity = Mastery Rank (x2 if Orokin Reactor/Catalyst installed).\n\nThe cap on capacity remains unchanged.\n\nPlease note this is a slight deviation of our discussions on how Mastery Rank will reflect gear level, but by affecting capacity it fundamentally enables you to use Mods the moment you get your hands on new gear or Forma an item. Have fun!\n\n\n\nHek Sound Changes\n\nAs widely requested, Hek‚Äôs original sound has been restored and our Sound Team has made it work with the new weapon sound tech.\n\nOur Audio Director, [DE]George, has provided insight into why we changed the Hek sound originally here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/536444-hek-shooting-sound/?do=findComment&comment=7327137\n\n\n\nChanges\n\nThe squad UI now shows who is in range with the Tenno Affinity marker.\nReduced the lens flare in the pause menu.\nLanka projectiles will now only increase the combo counter once per enemy hit when shot into Mag‚Äôs Magnetize. This also fixes firing the Lanka in Mag‚Äôs Magnetize bubble resulting in a massive unintended Sniper combo increase.\nIncreased the sound radius on Volt‚Äôs Speed pickup for allies. \nZephyr‚Äôs Tornado post FX and camera shake will only be visible to the caster. \nReduced the post FX of Zephyr‚Äôs Tornados when the Funnel Clouds Augment is equipped.\nImproved handling of corrupted installs (repair instead of crashing).\nFixes\n\nFixed dead players receiving shared Tenno Affinity.\nFixed a rare case of crashing from reviving a fallen Tenno.\nPossible fix for Chroma‚Äôs Effigy being invisible and dealing no damage as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/653506-chroma-effigy-bugged/\nFixed Loki's Radial Disarm increasing the number of enemies when cast in Kela De Thaym‚Äôs Arena.\nFixed backing out of the Arsenal after making a purchase and switching loadouts, reverting you back to the loadout you had equipped when entering the Arsenal.\nFixed Operator‚Äôs heads and hairstyles displaying the incorrect title.\nFixed having multiples of the same Chat Tab.\nPossible fix for Clients seeing the incorrect FX from The Nightwatch Napalm Mod. \nFixed Loki‚Äôs incorrect passive description. \nFixed multiple Bastille‚Äôs appearing when casted by Vauban in Mag‚Äôs Polarize.\nFixed Mag‚Äôs Magnetize bubble lingering permanently when Vauban‚Äôs Vortex/Bastille is thrown inside it. This also fixes intensified FX in this situation that caused performance issues. \nFixed Hydroid‚Äôs passive activating when punching with a fist weapon. \nFixed performance issues due to having 4+ Hyekka‚Äôs on screen.\nFixed the Aquiros Syandana hanging incorrectly. \nFixed missed discrepancy Mod descriptions. \nFixed more collisions on Orokin doors that cause players to get caught in between the gap and eaten by the door.\nFixed overlapping text of Mags abilities in the Tutorial UI.\nFixed Volt‚Äôs Electric Shield lingering for other players after disappearing for the caster.\nFixed Ash‚Äôs Arcane Locust and Arcane Scorpion Helmet not being tradable. \nFixed Ivara‚Äôs Prowl ability sound not cancelling out when casting a Focus ability.\nFixed seeing a random ‚ÄòLevel Up‚Äô notification with no context.\nPossible fix for crashing on shutdown when running DirectX 10 or 11.\nFixes Mesa‚Äôs Peacemaker effects sticking around permanently in rare situations. \nFixed numerous crashes.\n\n\n",

Please be conscious that some areas may appear overly or underlit. We will work to fix up any rough looking spots \nfeel free to send screenshots are way in bug threads throughout the appropriate subforums.\nWith Inaros, the sands of old have been swept away from U18 Warframe leaving behind a newer, more vibrant U18.5 Warframe. In many respects, 18.5 is a remastered, more HD version of Warframe with months of technical graphical improvements and artistic relighting of many parts of the game (and more to come in subsequent updates). On top of these changes are across the board rendering performance improvements we hope you'll enjoy, keep in mind that your particular hardware may benefit more and benefit less depending on your GPU, resolution and preferred graphics settings.\nLighting textures have been reengineered to reduce square compression artifacts and ugly color banding. You may have seen me point this out on past Devstreams. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†\nAll PBR materials have been recompressed with a more accurate format, new and subtle details are visible on your PBR'd Warframes, gear and in the environment. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†\nReflection Probes have been built through many areas of the game, grounding PBR materials with more accurate lighting. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†\nCharacter and weapon lighting includes more accurate 'dual specular' lighting which means metallic surfaces are more realistic and fancy looking. ¬† ¬† ¬†\nHDR rendering has been switched to a compact 32bit format which has improved HDR rendering performance for a wide range of GPUs. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†\nTonemapping has been adjusted to use more of the range of lighting content in the game, images have more detail, particularly richer in the darks. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†\nMotion Blur and Depth of Field have been re-engineered to run faster and look better, fast moving and defocused objects no longer appear 'cut out' on their silhouettes. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†\nDraw order optimizations have been applied to every object in the game, which improves overall performance, particularly in worst-case scenarios. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†\nAtmospheric fog effects are now rendering in a separate lighting pass, allowing richer particle effects at distance without being 'erased' by atmosphere. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†\nParticle lighting has been improved to more accurately represent the local lighting environment. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†\nWind force modelling on many particle systems increase realism as various environmental particles now respond to explosive forces and Warframe powers ‚Äì you've also probably seen us showcase this in our most recent Devstream. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†\nBloom system has been softened and made more seated in the scene. The burnt-out look is replaced with a more subtle and gentle sci-fi glow. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†\nPhysics collision, performance and stability have all been improved, as a long-awaited upgrade of Warframe PhysX libraries has been completed.\nInterception AI Improvements\nEnemies in Interception Missions have been overhauled to help improve the flow of combat over the course of the Mission. ¬†These improvements include:\nSuperior objective finding and hacking agent selection.\nBetter player tracking and more intuitive movement to Squad location.\nEnemies unable to hack (such as MOAs) will no longer move to engage hacking consoles.\nConclave Changes & Additions\nRecruit Conditioning has been enabled for all players who are Rank 0-2 with the Conclave Syndicate:\nPlayers who are Rank 0-2

Radial damage values have been significantly lowered on melee ground attacks, especially for the Galatine, Gram, and Jat Kittag. Exact ranges are as follows:\nJat Kittag from 10 meters to 6 meters.\nGram and Galatine from 5 meters to 4 meters.\n\nIt is no longer possible to be knocked down while in air from a melee slam.\n\n\nSpawning fixes and tileset tweaks over the past year greatly improved flow by reducing enemy travel time to players, upped the intensity of attackers and grouped enemies together into more tightly packed squads, and increased availability of points during spawn selection. While we're happy with these changes to enemies, one side effect is that survival difficulty drifted over the past few months to where it is now; plentiful large canisters and no reason to use them, even when not trying to stockpile them.\nWe'd like to bring back the original frantic gameplay style of Survival, dashing from room to room while facing hordes of enemies against the clock. We've tried this solo, in small teams and in full squads, everything from Apollodorus to T4 Survival, and as far as we can tell the changes feel awesome.\nUpcoming Changes:\n\nEach PLS drop is now worth +4 seconds of life support time instead of +6 seconds\n\nSmall reduction to PLS drop rate (around 90% of what it was)\nWe'd love to hear your feedback and will continue to test and tweak if needed.\n\n\nTyl Regor has been granted immunity during stage transitions in his boss fight.\n\nCore rewards in Endless Derelict Missions now reward in bundles of 3 instead of just a single core.\nMutagen rewards in Endless Derelict Missions have been replaced with Mutalist Alad V Coordinates.\nAdded new reward table for Caches in Derelict Sabotage missions.\nChanged number of Uncommon Fusion Cores given in Ocean Sabotage Caches to 3 instead of 5.\nLoki's Radial Disarm now knocks enemies off emplacements when cast instead of destroying them.\nPlayers can no longer bullet-jump out of the Cephalon Suda room in the Relays.\n\n",

the Stolen Dreams Quest. ¬†From there players can acquire The New Strange and accept it from the Codex once they return to the Liset.\n\nA master of the deadly elements, Chroma can alter his damage output by changing his energy coloring.\nChroma‚Äôs powers include:\n\n\nTenno are out for vengeance, and Grineer Councilor Vay Hek has nowhere left to hide. ¬†Hot on his trail after the assault on

into the heart of Grineer military power.\n\nCreate a squad of 4 to 8 Tenno and work through three challenge scenarios as you track down Vay Hek across the Solar System.\nEarn Arcane enhancements from defeating Vay Hek, each of which provide a unique bonus Warframes can unleash during combat.\nIn order to equip an Arcane enhancement players must construct it in their Foundry under the Miscellaneous

After a couple years of talk, we finally were able to set up a Test cluster which could be accessed externally. This Test cluster housed the many iterations of Update 16 content.\n\nFor 1 week straight leading up to this update, a group of just under 20 veteran Tenno spent hours and hours each day playing together, giving feedback, finding bugs, and voicing concerns. Each day included tireless attempts at the incredibly difficult Raids, hilarious moments competing in PvP, and general exploration of all things new. This past week has been one for the memory books \nabout 60+ hours together with veteran Tenno who applied their skill to some of our hardest and most surprising content yet. I loved every minute of it, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what we can do for quality with the potential that this Test cluster has opened!\nRebecca\n",

You must plan your actions quickly and accordingly in this Quest.

Blueprint.\n\nThis new Quest is available for all players Mastery Rank 3 or greater.\n\n\nWhile our old Spy game mode certainly had small spy-like focus in stealing intel, most of the time players were happy to loudly murder their way through the enemy to get the job done. ¬†Who could blame anyone? ¬†That‚Äôs why we sat down and gave Spy a total overhaul.\n\nWith new elements focused on avoiding laser grids and sneaking past guards, stealth is paramount in Spy 2.0. ¬†Being detected will mean losing rewards and bonus Affinity, even when the Mission is complete.\n\nThe following nodes have been updated to include this new Spy game mode:\n\nMercury \nSuisei\nVenus \nVesper, Unda\nMars \nMartialis\nJupiter \nAdrastea\nSaturn \nTitan, Aegaeon\nUranus \nUmbriel, Rosalind\nNeptune

exciting improvements to stealth combat! ¬†Players will now find that sneaking around each Mission may come with some excellent rewards. ¬†These alterations to stealth gameplay will continue to evolve based upon player feedback, but for now stealth aficionados can sink their teeth into the following changes:\n\n\n\nWe‚Äôve made a wide variety of improvements to Warframe in some obvious, and not-so-obvious ways. ¬†The following is a quick list of changes we‚Äôve made, and where you‚Äôll notice them the most!\n\n\n\nThe following Mission Nodes on the Star Chart have had missing and mismatched rewards fixed.\n\nCeres \nBode (Capture)\nPhobos \nLimtoc, Todd (Capture)\nUranus \nTrinculo (Capture)\nEuropa \nValefor (Excavation)\nEuropa \nZagan, Morax (Exterminate)\nEris \nViver (Hive)\nSedna \nUndine (Sabotage)\nEuropa \nGamygyn (Sabotage)\nIn addition, changes have been made for Defense, Survival, Mobile Defense, Exterminate and Rescue. ¬†Previously these Missions were not properly balanced to reflect the Mission's enemy levels, sometimes resulting in fewer enemies than intended in higher level Missions and more at lower level Missions.\n\n\nTo simulate waves and grouped up enemies, previously survival enemy spawns cycled on and off for short periods of time. ¬†While it was a simple way of adding the desired pacing, we found that it was possible for players to get 'in sync' with killing enemies at certain times which left gaps of time where there were no enemies to kill and no enemies spawning, especially in higher level Missions with four players.\n\nSpawning now fluctuates dynamically with each enemy spawned. ¬†Max spawn rate is the same, but it's now the time between individual enemy spawns which changes instead of a blanket 'on' or 'off' state for all enemy spawning. ¬†Hopefully you will start to see more consistent spawning in higher level Missions with four players, as well as squads of enemies attacking together. ¬†In our tests we found that there wasn't a notable difference in low level Missions.\n\nSmall life support drop rate was tweaked to compensate for the changes.\nAlthough we have playtested extensively, we are always interested in your feedback. ¬†Please be sure to let us know how these changes may have affected your gameplay experience in the appropriate subforum: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/forum/237-mission/\n\nStar Chart node changes have been made to balance the available nodes across factions, tilesets and difficulty. ¬†The following nodes have received changes:\n\nSaturn \nKeeler: Changed Survival node to Grineer Asteroid Mobile Defense\nSaturn\n¬†Cassini: Changed to Asteroid tileset (was Galleon)\nPhobos \nFlimnap: New Survival Grineer Asteroid node (was Deception)\nEuropa \nZagan: New Survival Corpus ship (was Exterminate)\nNeptune \nDespina: New Survival Corpus ship (was Defense)\nCeres \nNuovo: Changed to Galleon tileset (was Shipyards tileset)\n\n\nShields and HP are two critical elements to keep track of in Warframe, but when fighting enemies it can be difficult to keep track of how much damage you‚Äôve taken in the heat of combat. ¬†This Update contains new visual and audio cues for when your Warframe takes damage in combat.\n\nWhen taking damage in combat damage will sound different depending on if your shields are down or intact. ¬†Additionally shields ‚Äòbreaking‚Äô have a new audio cue to help you better keep track of when your health is exposed to enemy fire.\n\nAdditional Sound Adjustments\n\nThis Update includes multiple improvements to sound immersion. ¬†Among these changes are:\n\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Improved audio on bullet impact, making it easier to hear where shots as passing by (or where your rounds are being spent).\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Improvements to the Grakata's audio.\n¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sliding will now provide different sound effects, depending on what surface the player is on.\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of variables that go into making an NPC more or less deadly, and accuracy plays a huge role in what enemies are most feared. ¬†These new adjustments to enemy accuracy will dramatically change how players handle foes.\n\nEach enemy will have increased (or decreased) odds of hitting a player based on the type of weapon they‚Äôre using. ¬†Sniper rifles, for example, will have higher accuracy at long range but will be more difficult for NPCs to use in close-range combat. ¬†Not only that, but our new system allows us to create custom draw rates that make some weapons more difficult for enemies to aim quickly with.\n\nThese changes represent an ongoing state of development for our NPC accuracy; and we welcome player feedback on this subtle, under-the-hood change to be made in the appropriate subforum. ¬†For more information on our accuracy adjustments please check the following thread in our Developer Workshop: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/395422-npc-accuracy/\n\n\nSaryn‚Äôs Molt will now transfer enemies that ‚Äòlatch on‚Äô to Warframes (Brood Mother Maggots, Swarm Moa Swarms, etc) instead

We have just detected a Balor Fomorian traveling on an interception course with Vesper Relay. The beast moves slowly but if we allow it to get within firing range, it will surely obliterate our new Relay. We need to destroy it before that happens.\nIntelligence reports state that the Balor Fomorian‚Äôs power core emits a thick energy field composed of deadly omega radiation. In order to break through the field you will need to craft this Fomorian Disruptor. It will allow you to safely approach the core and when activated it will temporarily disrupt the core allowing you to inflict damage.\nTake note Tenno, the Disruptor is forged using recently discovered Omega Isotopes. These are a by-product of a Fomorian‚Äôs core and will only appear in and around planets with a Fomorian present.\nMove quickly Tenno, this is the first Balor Fomorian attack but it won‚Äôt be the last. When the others come we must be ready.\n\n\nThe Lotus\n\n\n\nFomorian Vessels will intermittently appear in the Solar System as event nodes. These event nodes will be locked until you have the Fomorian Disruptor in your Consumable Inventory.\n\nYou will receive a Blueprint from the Lotus for the Fomorian Disruptor. It will require Nano Spores, Cryotic, and Omega Isotopes to craft.\n\nBuild your Disruptor in the Foundry and equip it in your Gear Menu to start the Fomorian Sabotage Mission.\n\nOnce in the Mission, fly to the Fomorian. Once you‚Äôre close enough to the Fomorian you must disable the exterior Shield Cores so you can enter the ship.\n\nThe Fomorian‚Äôs internal Shield Generators are protected by a magnetic field. Use your Fomorian Disruptor from the Gear menu to disrupt the magnetic field, and temporarily expose the Shield Generators, allowing you to destroy them.\n\nWith the Shield Generators destroyed you can now deal damage to the ship‚Äôs Main Reactor Power Cores.\n\nAfter damaging the cores, escape to safety outside the Fomorian.\n\n\n\nCompleting a successful Sabotage run will earn you event points, and reduce the global health of the Fomorian.\n\nYour Fomorian Disruptor will be consumed after completing the Fomorian Sabotage mission.\n\nThis Operation is on now until Monday, January 5 at 12 PM EST.\n\n\n\nCompleting the Fomorian Sabotage mode successfully will earn you one Battle Point.\n\nYou can earn a maximum of one Battle Point per Fomorian. Repeating the same Fomorian will not generate additional Battle Points. These points will count towards individual rewards.\n\nFomorian missions with a higher level of difficulty will provide extra points.\nLeaderboards are available for players that want to compete for the best score during Fomorian Sabotage Missions. Your individual score is determined by the amount of damage dealt to the Fomorian Power Core during a single run. The highest scores can only be achieved by squads with coordinated deployment of Fomorian Disruptors, and efficient attacks on the Power Cores.\n\n\nClan Scoring considers the following:\n\nYour score will be based on the most damage dealt to the Fomorian Power Core in a given mission. Clan score is sum of personal best but divided by max clan size for that tier (ie: 10 for Ghost Clan, 1000 for Moon).\n\n\n\n3 BATTLE POINTS: Eyes of Blight Skin Pack (Badge + Rahk Fluctus Skin)\n10 BATTLE POINTS: Eyes of Blight Mod Pack (Magma Chamber + Searing Steel)\n15 BATTLE POINTS: Imperator Vandal\n\nClan Scoring: The Top three Clans in each tier will be awarded with Gold, Silver and Bronze Statues.\nTake down the Fomorian Ships, Tenno!\n\n\n\nPlayers can check out the Leaderboards for Operation Eyes of Blight here: http://content.warframe.com/dynamic/eyesOfBlight.php\n\nLeaderboards are updated every 15 minutes for Clans, and every 5 minutes for players. ¬†Good luck, and may the best Tenno win!\n\nOmega Isotopes: Produced by a Fomorian‚Äôs power core, these particles only appear on planets where a Fomorian is present. ¬†Omega Isotopes can only be obtained in non-Archwing missions where a Fomorian vessel is present.\n\n\n\nFixed Soma Prime and Vasto Prime not being visible in the Codex.\nFixed duplicate Stance Mods appearing in Codex as per: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/369502-duplicated-entries-on-the-mod-codex-shield-disruption-and-cleaving-whirlwind/\nFixed the Breach Loader Mod showing an incorrect description in the Arsenal.\nFixed audio issue when interrupting the Supra mid-reload.\nFixed non-Archwing Pistol and Shotgun Mods appearing in Archwing Missions.\nFixed the word ‚ÄòSCANNING‚Äô appearing in the Codex for non-localized descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

  "changes": "Additions:\n\nAdded Rank display to item browsing, meaning you can now see what rank your gear is in the inventory. As an example, in the scenario of building an Aklex and you have three, one which is Rank 30, you can now see the item's rank in this new display!\nUnlisted 14.6.0 change: There is now a Dojo chat tab when in the Dojo!\n\n\nTrinity's Blessing is now recastable while passive damage reduction is active. This means you no longer need to wait for your Duration timers to expire before being able to recast Blessing.\n\nFirstly, an explanation in intent and next steps:\nDev observed and experienced the uninhibited blinding effect in up to a 60 M Range with several environments coming between Excalibur and targets. This prompted review.\nSecondly, the 14.6.0 changes have all been reverted as they were experimental and not intended to function in the way they did for this brief 12 hour window.\nThirdly, what you can expect down the road is Radial Blind functioning in a way that considers Line-of-sight. The 14.6.0 unintended version suffered from a lot of problems with this approach, and coming will be radically improved line-of-sight checks for Radial Blind. Targets behind cover that can still see Excalibur are blinded. Other bodies won‚Äôt inhibit their blindness, but walls will.\n\n\nFirst, a quick brief in the history of changes this Mod has undergone:\nThis Mod was originally fixed to not give a player energy for damage that was never dealt to player. When we added the damage predeath state in Conclaves, etc, the original fix was unintentionally reverted.\nThe 14.6.0 fix resolves issues where Rage + Quick Thinking gave effective permanent invulnerability because energy was being added to pool that was never dealt to player. With this change in mind, the combination of Rage and Quick Thinking may seem less efficient as before due to no longer giving effective invulnerability. The scope of this change is being monitored to ensure the usefulness of these Mods as a combination.\n\n\nChanged loading screen/matchmaking logic to move on if after 10 seconds Client is unable to properly join/connect. Elaboration: Fixes entire squad being stuck on loading screen while waiting for low end PC to load.\nChanged the attack ferocity of Corpus Mine Osprey: before no maximum existed on number of deployed mines, and now there is a maximum of 6.\nRemoved Kubrow roaming in Liset until further notice.\nTweaked performance of Local Reflections code on Dx10 and Dx11 to address potential FPS loss.\nPvP Bladestorm balancing:-Reduced maximum number of attacks to [2, 3, 4, 5] to address issues with players getting stuck in Bladestorm-ed state for up to 15+ hits.-Increased the PvP damage multiplier from 0.1 per hit to 0.5 per hit in an effort to keep damage output in line with previous values.\n",
  "fixes": "\nFixed issue with Captain Vor being unbeatable on Mercury.\nFixed an issue with Nova‚Äôs Molecular Prime explosions caused by self-destructing enemies damaging teammates and defense objectives.\nFixed issues with users connecting behind proxies being unable to update the game.\nFixed an issue where Lotus would constantly talk to you at the end of Survival Alerts.\nFixed a game freeze that would occur when attempting to fuse or change mods.\nFixed game freeze when focusing on the categories menu after opening the item browsing screen in Foundry.\nFixed interception console ‚Äòhitswitch‚Äô pushing AI through the terrain on Grineer maps.\nFixed navigation issues that prevented faithful Kubrow from joining in the fight against Lephantis.\nFixed issues with Void missions not pausing when playing Solo and hitting ESC.\nFixed several crashes.\n",

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm concerned about the coming Balor Fomorians. I think we both know your Warframes are simply not sophisticated enough to stop them.\n\nBut I can help you... for a price.\n\nYou see, I have an appetite for the rare and extraordinary and I‚Äôve recently learned of a fine substance known as Cryotic. If you are willing, I will supply the necessary equipment and coordinates for its extraction. In return, I will enlighten you with what I know about technology that could defeat this Balor threat.\n\nTo sweeten the deal I am even willing award bonuses to those of you who exhibit outstanding performance.\n\nI must say, some of you display the inklings of good taste, if our partnership is a success perhaps we will get to know each other better.\n\nRegards,\n\nYour New Associate\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay the new Excavation missions!\n\n\nThe Location of a ‚ÄòScanning Device‚Äô will appear on your minimap for you to locate.\n\n\nCollect Power Cells dropped by enemies, and bring them to the Scanner to activate it and keep it powered. You can track your Scanner‚Äôs power in the map on your HUD. If it reaches 0%, the process will stall until power is restored.\n\n\nDefend the Scanner as it searches for a dig site. Once the Scanner has found a site, it will appear on your map. Proceed to that location to find an Excavator that is digging for artifacts.\n\n\nTake caution! ¬†Enemy waves will attempt to destroy the Excavator, and you must defend it. The Excavator will also continue to lose power. As with the Scanner, you must collect Power Cells to keep it activated.\n\n\nOnce the Excavator has uncovered the artifact, you may choose to Extract from the operation or wait for another Scanner and repeat the process.\n\n\nThere are three available Tilesets for this Operation.\n\n\nWhat is CRYOTIC (New Resource)?\n\nUsually found in extreme sub-zero environments, Cryotic instantly freezes anything it comes in contact with.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Excavator is destroyed before it recovers an item, the mission is a failure.\n\n\nThe Operation is on now until Wednesday, September 3 at 12 PM EDT.\n\n\nOperation Cryotic Front is the first introduction of a new mission type that will replace all Survival missions that take place on a terrestrial tileset.\n\n\nThis Operation introduces Cryotic, a new resource that will only be available in the Excavation game mode.\n\n\nAt each of the point levels below and you‚Äôll unlock a new Tileset in the Operation. It‚Äôs your choice ‚Äì continue to dig on Earth or take your efforts to these new areas. Note that each new Tileset will hold more difficult enemies but will provide the opportunity to earn points faster.\n\n\n\n\nWith each successful dig, you will receive an amount of Cryotic based on your performance (100 max.) The more Cryotic you earn, the better the Reward ‚Äì so dig on!\n\nMore than 500 pts = Event Badge\n\nMore than 1000 pts = Ice Mod Set (4 dual-stat mods)\n\nMore than 3000 pts = Latron Wraith and the Polar Glaxion skin\n\n\n\nNote: The basis for the rewards is your best score in one single run.\n\n\n\n\nThe top three Clans per Clan Tier will receive Gold, Silver, and Bronze Trophies. For Clan Leaderboards, a Clan‚Äôs score is the sum of active personal bests.\n\nPlease be aware that people joining clans after the event has started will not contribute to their new clans score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Added new Colour Customization options available through 2 new packs!

This radial blind will be applied to enemies that move into range after it‚Äôs been cast and are blinded by the impact of those being slammed by Reckoning!\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Made Vauban's Vortex scale with power range and duration mods.\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¢ Nyx‚Äôs Absorb has had it‚Äôs passive energy drain significantly reduced from 10 energy per second to 4 energy per second, and instead now has an energy drain based on incoming damage.

These drainage values are affected with the use of mods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¢ In an effort to compensate for more useful attribution of XP when triggering a chain reaction with Molecular Prime, the main XP is attributed to whoever started the chain reaction. Before, Nova would take the bulk of the attribution. Now, ¬†the \"weapon and instigator\" carry through the whole explosion chain ( if Player A casts Molecular Prime and Player B blows up the room, Player B gets the kills and XP).

  "additions": "\nDynamic Music has been added to all Grineer and Infested missions, with Corpus coming soon! The game now more ‚Äòintelligently‚Äô makes decisions about how to play ambient and combat music. We are using a stem approach so that players hear different parts of the music at all times!\n\nMirage‚Äôs Harlequin Helmet\nHydroid‚Äôs Ketos Helmet!\nZephyr‚Äôs Tengu Helmet!\nAdded friendly NPC wall running. Specters, Rescue targets and Kubrow can learn where to wall run from the players.\nAdded Eximus/Leader spawn scaling to Defense missions.\nAdded an extra boost to wall-run melee attacks if you channel melee.\nAdded CPU performance improvements.\nAlliance Emblems have been added for Warlords/Alliance Founder to upload at www.warframe.com\nAlliance Renames are here! Sick of being called the Tootsie Roll Slammers? Now you can change to the Jawbreakin‚Äô Jostlers!\nAdded new Wall Run + Strike animations for Axe, Scythe, Staff, and Claw weapons.\nAdded the ability for Founding Warlords of a clan to demote other Warlords. Please note this is only possible for clans founded after we started flagging the detail of clan Founder, which occurred shortly after Update 13.\nAdded visual effect on friendly hacked Moas.\nAdded the ability to Slide Jump into a wall run. Before you would just slide and jump at the wall, but now, if aimed and the correct functions pressed, this will transition into a wall run.\nAdded support for additional aspect ratios.\nAdded in a graphics option to disable Anisotropic Filtering. This should help with increase performance by approximately 10% on Intel HD Graphics units.\nAdded an ‚Äòaccept all‚Äô pending friend requests option as a context action under the accept friend menu.\nAdded a new Animation when you use a Revive in a session.\nAdded all 3 Diorama Winners from the Diorama Contest of days past! Congratulations to Casardis, 9Hopper, and FireTempest. Find the dioramas in the Codex!\n",
  "changes": "Molt has received an Art and Effects overhaul!\nMolt now removes Procs and Status Effects when cast.\nHysteria has been reworked with an entirely new animation set and sounds! Activate Valkyr‚Äôs Hysteria to play through the new combos and movement set!\nValkyr‚Äôs Hysteria now is affected by the melee ‚Äòcombo‚Äô counter bonuses! The higher your combo chain, the more damage Hysteria will do!\nVolt's Electric Shield now has a countdown timer. In the case of multiple spawned shields, the time for the last spawned one will be displayed (similar to Frost's Snowglobe).\n\nScorpions will now be able to pull players who are ‚Äòoff nav‚Äô, which means on boxes or other areas off the main path.\nEnemies health is no longer capped at 65535.\n\nAll Crawlers move speed has been increased.\nNew animations for Infested Ancient reach attack.\nElectric Crawler Attack range fixed, now more likely to attack with his lightning.\nLobber Crawler has new effects on his lobbed grenade, making it easier to see.\nInfested Charger move speed increased.\nSuicide Runners will no longer explode on death if killed by melee. The death explosion causes stagger, and damage scales up with their level.\nInfested Leapers: Their leaping attack can be parried to nullify the stagger. Leap damage scales with their level.\nAll Ancients can pull targets (Pull can be blocked or dodged).\nAll Ancients \nbetter anticipation of knockdown attack. It can now be parried to nullify damage and the knockdown.\nToxic Ancients \nDo poison damage and gives all nearby enemies poison damage. Ancient and nearby enemies are resistant to poison and gas damage.\nHealing Ancients \nLinks with nearby allies, any damage they take heals the Ancient up to 150% health, and it scales up to reflect having health > 100%. Also reduces damage that nearby allies take.\nHealing Ancient now has Fossilized health, to be consistent with the other Ancients (was Infested Armour).\nLeaper infested can dodge.\nDisruptor Ancients \nAura that reduces radial and power damage taken by nearby allies. Attack damage energy, rather than completely drain it. Attacks of nearby allies have the same effect.\nThe following bosses have gone through a balancing pass to improve their scaling for groups of high level Tenno, we hope they are a little more challenging!\nGrustrag 3, Hyena Pack, Vay Hek, Jackal, Alad V and Zanuka, Sargas Ruk, Lephantis, and Captain Vor.\nSpeaking to the Jackal, The Jackal had some additional fixes to reduce the amount of stun locking possible and also allowing him to scale better with level. The health of his legs was changed to a % of his total health, which scales up with level, making it harder to knock him into his stun state. His stun timer was also decreased while the damage required to break him out of stun early was also increased and made as a % of his total health rather than a set value.\nMade several changes to the Derelict Survival mission to improve spawning.\nPolished the logic for connecting procedural levels.\nIncreased the number of connectors to increase play space.\nIncreased spawn room chance.\nRemoved tentacle traversal room (Giant open room which branches are navigated) from intermediate spawning, will only occur as dead end.\n\nRemoved the locked door to extraction, as it only limits the available spawn locations within the first 5 minutes.\nIncreased the number of small dead end rooms (caps) which can generate in place of red locked doors, providing more spawn locations for enemies.\nAdded some new small cap tiles for Asteroid, Settlement, Outpost and Galleon tilesets.\nRestructured the Derelict Survival procedural level so it has more small tiles between the main areas. ¬†There are still three larger main areas which have life support capsule spawn points. ¬†\nThe 'stacking' bug was fixed, capsules don't spawn instantly on activating a capsule if the level is full.\nThe first room's capsule spawns are no longer switched off after one use. ¬†Since the first room is reused, each level may now have 2-3 more simultaneous capsules active before it reaches capacity. ¬†Originally the level structure was a little different, disabling spawns was intended to keep players closer to extraction after moving on from the first room.\nAdded infested crawlers to survival enemy spec.\n\nOptimized game memory to improve stability for 32-bit systems and reduce load-times. This optimization includes up to ‚Öì less data being loaded on boot.\nCompleting an Alert on a node you have locked no longer unlocks the node underneath.\nRemoved blood/dismembered Grineer from Excalibur's codex entry ...he didn't mean to hurt anyone.\nIncreased decoration capacity in the trophy room for adequate trophy placement.\nChanges to mod art: Decisive Judgement and Tranquil Cleave used the same image, now they don‚Äôt!\nChanged Ruk‚Äôs image in the ‚ÄúEnemies‚Äù section of the Codex.\nChanges to visual effect when Melee killing an enemy while Channeling.\nImproved performance on effects that use the the particle system.\nRevisited Nekros tinting.\nLoki Prime's decoy now holds a Lex Prime!\nMaterial updates to Corpus ship hull Cores.\nMade curved walls larger to better support wall runs in the Orokin Void.\nTweaked the Bow Idle animations on Loki, Mag, Valkyr, and Hydroid Warframes.\nImproved Melee Ground Attack position accuracy.\nTweaked the sound effects for all Warframes entering Smoke Screen.\nImproved the positioning of melee accessories on Boomerang weapons (Kestrel).\nImproved the cast sound effect for Loki's Radial Disarm ability.\nImproved the performance of multiple general environmental effects.\nLimited the max instances of Karak, Soma, and Gorgon fire sound effects.\nLimited the max instances of Cestra fire sound effects.\nLimited the max instances of Dex Furis fire sound effects.\nTweaked the sound effect for Loki‚Äôs Decoy cast and spawn in sound effects.\nPlayer's can no longer be staggered when quick Meleeing with the Glaive.\nPolished some of Tyl Regor's animations.\nImproved the cast sound for Volt's Speed ability.\nTweaked the weapon fire sound effects on the Corpus Crewmen and Moa.\nTweaked the weapon fire sound effects on the Dera and Hind.\nTweaked the sounds of the Grineer rifle melee attack sound effects.\nAdjusted the Helmet position of Corrupted Crewmen.\nImproved the performance of the Interception territory area indicator.\nImproved the visuals on Mag's Pull ability.\nLoki's Decoy ability deploy sound effect is now positional and will not be heard by players past a certain distance.\nIncreased the volume of Vauban's power cast sound effects.\nReduced the pitch variance in Axe sound effects.\nImproved the performance of a number of Forest Defense tileset decorations.\nImproved performance on the Torid and Drakgoon Effects.\nReduced the amount of resonance on Axe hit sound effects.\nLimited the instances of Corpus Laser Weapon fire sound effects.\nImproved the performance of a number of Gas City tilesets.\nOptimized a number of lighting assets in the Grineer Galleon tilesets in an effort to increase performance.\nRemoved blood decals from bleeding procs as this caused performance issues on certain terrain sets.\nTweaked the duration and fade on multiple Hydroid ability sound effects.\nOptimized a number of lighting assets in Corpus Ship tilesets in an effort to increase performance.\nImproved the weapon trail visuals on Whip type weapons.\nOptimized the performance of particle effects.\nTweaked the slide animations when holding Great Sword weapons.\nUpdated multiple Warframe dioramas with proper colors.\nImproved the Grineer Hit reactions to Radial Disarm.\nImproved the performance of Ash's Smoke Screen on lower end PC's.\n\n",

Find it today in the market or in the Tenno Research lab!\nNew Pyra Syandana! A flaming remnant of the Orokin Elite!\n\nChanges:\n13.8.1 Unlisted change: Enemies now have basic awareness on contact or sound of invisible units, and will investigate last known position of this sound/contact. ¬†There are a number of threads bringing up issues/discussions with this that are being read and relayed, thank you for posting!\nInfested Drones have been removed from Defense missions. This is primarily due to issues with navigation and the flow of wave gameplay. We are working on improving their ability to navigate these levels for future inclusion.\nTweaked the positioning of the Edo armor Chest piece to address clipping/placement issues.\nSlightly reduced the overall damage resistances of Prosecutor enemy types.\nThe drop rates on Beacons have been adjusted. Delta Beacons are now less rare, with the Kappa and Gamma Beacon drop rates being slightly reduced.\nTweaked the positioning of the Eos leg armor accessories.\nChanges made to Volt‚Äôs Shield Ability in response to a fix made last week. Before there was an issue that casting 2 or more of Volt‚Äôs Shields would stop projectiles from reaching their end destination. We fixed this so projectiles could pass through as many shields that were deployed, but the damage multiplier stacked, resulting in broken numbers. We have returned the damage multiplier to it‚Äôs normal value to be calculated once, and shields no longer stack this multiplier.\nShifted Banshee's shoulder pad back slightly to reduce clipping.\nTweaked the position of Emblems so as to ensure they don't clip into shoulder armor.\nFixes:\nFixed an issue with Bladestorm attacks against Prosecutors immune to the Elemental Damage on the attacking player's weapon not dealing damage correctly. Not yet fixed.\nFixed an issue with the blade section of the Orthos not being able to be customized.\nFixed a number of localization issues.\nFixed an non-existent Fusion Core appearing in the codex resulting in confusion over completion of total cards.\nFixed being able to use alternate fire during certain animations.\nFixed an issue with the alt fire on the Mutalist Quanta being duplicated by Nyx's Absorb ability.\nFixed issues with rotation of Event Emblems on Wyrm Prime.\nFixed an issue with Mag Prime's shoulder not using the correct texture.\nFixed (for real) Infested Drones appearing on Defense Missions until Nav Improvements are made.\nFixed Sabotage missions not having machines/objectives to be destroyed, resulting in mission that could not be completed.\n",

  "fixes": "\n\nOperation: Breeding Grounds!\n\nTenno, we have a problem.\nAlad V has developed a way to direct the spread of the Infestation. Using these newly engineered \"Hive\" organisms, the Infestation is able to corrupt a new ship or colony almost instantly. There are also disturbing reports coming in that the virus has evolved. It is now capable of absorbing and corrupting non-organic beings. Not even the robotic soldiers of the Corpus are safe now. The only way to stop the spread is to destroy these hives.\nWe have just received word of a massive outbreak near Eris. An entire fleet of Corpus ships has been exposed to this new bioplague. Alad V is almost certainly responsible. If Alad V's hives are allowed to gain a strategic foothold here, the Infested will become unstoppable. They will overrun the system in a matter of days. If we don‚Äôt put an end to this now, the Corpus, the Grineer, the Tenno...we could all fall in the wake of this horrible scourge.\n-The Lotus\n\n\nOperation: Breeding Grounds will include point structure that allows for rewards based on points earned in ONE SINGLE mission! This will be denoted in the UI in the \"Best\" field under the Operations tab to help you keep track of your current best score.\n6 points: Breeding Grounds badge!\n17 points: Dual Stat Fire Mods!\n48 points: Prova Vandal!\nThe top 3 Clans per Clan Tier will receive Gold, Silver, and Bronze ‚ÄúBreeding Grounds‚Äù Trophies! For Clan Leaderboards, a Clan‚Äôs score is the sum of the Best Point run for all members.\n\n\nDifficulty of the mission is increased in the following way:\n\nYou will notice a \"Total\" value in the UI under the Operations tab. The higher this number, the stronger the stink and more difficult the missions! All Tenno will begin playing ‚ÄòDifficulty 1‚Äô missions with ‚ÄòDifficulty 1‚Äô hives! But, this difficulty won‚Äôt stay at ‚Äò1‚Äô forever. The Infested can smell the carnage of your missions and will become more and more difficult and aggressive the more Breeding Ground missions you complete. It will take several runs for the stink of the Infested to stick to you. By completing more missions, you will encounter more difficult hives and more difficult enemies! These difficulty increases will allow you to yield higher points in a single run, with endless potential if you want to compete in clan leaderboards!\nNote: grouping together with other Tenno will have an affect on difficulty depending on the level of combined stench!\nEnjoy! We plan on making Hive Sabotage a permanent addition to the game down the road, so let us know what you think!\n\nFixed a number of crashes.\nFixed Conclave bug where Conclave Score check did not occur if you joined a session from your friends list or via invite. This bug allowed users with any Conclave Loadout Value to join any Conclave node, regardless of enforced restrictions (1300 CR loadouts joining 100-150 Conclave Nodes).\nFixed an instance of the camera shake visual effect appearing incorrectly.\nFixed certain Dojo rooms not having message boards above the room management consoles.\nFixed an instance of Fatal Attraction not working correctly for Clients.\nFixed a number of localization issues.\nFixed an issue with Orokin Shield drones breaking when affected by Radial Disarm.\nFixed an issue with players getting stuck in Ash‚Äôs Bladestorm.\nFixed an animation ‚Äòpop‚Äô seen when unequipping Gauntlet type weapons.\nFixed an issue with players using their Melee attacks instead of attacking with Hysteria animations during the ability duration.\nFixed an issue with abilities not being properly available if one or more abilities are not currently equipped.\nFixed an issue with Clients leaving Key missions sometimes resulting in the Host losing a key.\nFixed an issue with Clients sometimes being able to throw unlimited amounts of Castanas which they could not detonate.\nFixed an issue with the Large Corpus Exploding Barrel displaying the wrong image in the Codex.\nFixed an issue with conveyor belts in the Shipyards tilesets appearing to rotate in the wrong direction.\nFixed issue where Banshee‚Äôs Silence FX does not disappear when the power duration is cancelled by a teleport volume (falling off map and respawning).\nFixed Rubedo Skin not working on Rhino Prime.\n\n",

You may recall the existence of ‚Äòred crits‚Äô from many updates ago, which occurred with no clear formula other than ‚ÄúSynapse!‚Äù. Here is some clarity into the new system:\n\nThe brief:\n\nA weapon with a critical chance greater than 100% will receive 2 calculations:\n\n1) a guaranteed critical damage value \nthis normally appears as a yellow value.\n\nThis means:\nIf your rate is 125% you get one guaranteed crit and a 25% chance of a red crit.\n\nIf this Second Crit occurs, you will see a deadly Red crit value!\n\n\nAsh\nBlade Storm has received a rework! Now when the ability is used Ash will conjure up to two separate clones which will go on the attack in addtion to the player! This will allow the player clear out large groups of enemies even quicker!\nChanges:\nMiter base damage has been increased along with the flight speed and proc chance of charged shots\nIncreased Fatal Attraction's range and damage at Rank 4 and 5.\nThe Fatal Attraction precept will now wait until enemies are within range before the pull ability is initialized.\nTweaked the positioning on the Leg Armor accessories for a number of Warframes.\nAdded in an additional range based visual effect on Molecular Prime that should help with distinguishing the distance of targets affected by the ability.\nTweaked the Excalibur Prime Channeling visual effects.\nSpecters will now re-generate Energy over time now so as to allow them to continue to use Powers over long amounts of time.\nPlayer movement is now prohibited at the start of Conclave rounds.\nTweaked the sound effects for the Skana Prime.\nReduced the amount of damage dealt to attacking players when using Reflection in PvP matches.\nTweaked the visuals on Valkyr's Immortal Skin.\nTweaked the sound effects on the Moa Laser Disc gun explosion and Drone Explosion.\nReduced required scans for Grineer Rollers.\nImproved the animations for the Greatsword and Axe animation sets.\nThe first round of Interception missions will now be easier for Solo players with enemies spawning throughout the mission.

Changing this option now takes effect immediately (ie: no game restart required).\n\nMade all Warframe components sellable (1000 CR each).\n\nChanged Lotus transmissions to reduce chatter: added delay to Mobile Defense reminders, Heavy Unit transmissions now have a 2 minute cool-down and can occur at most 3 times per mission.\n\nLoki‚Äôs Invisibility no longer reduces the volume of dialog and music.\n\nChanged logic that determines visual representation of damage mods on continuous-fire weapons (eg: Synapse, Ignis, etc).\nThe frequency of damage numbers used to be limited by using a minimum damage threshold. Since damage mods increase the rate at which damage accumulates, this would cause damage to be inflicted more often though each damage event would not necessarily be larger. This led to people thinking the mods did nothing because they didn't notice the increased rate at which numbers would appear (an easy mistake for low level damage mods). Similarly, headshots would make numbers appear more often but not necessarily create bigger numbers.\nNow continuous fire weapons now limit the frequency of damage numbers by using a minimum time between impacts, regardless of how much damage has accumulated. This gives us a lot more control and should make things more obvious for players who are applying damage mods (it's easier to notice that numbers are 5% larger in magnitude vs being generated 5% faster)‚Äù\n\n",

  "fixes": "Hotfix 11.1.2\n\nChanges:\n\n\nA lot of players have expressed that the ‚Äú15 minute mark‚Äù reward tier is often the most desirable for Survival missions. Changes have been made to Survival Reward tiers reward logic to reflect this feedback. We now cycle more efficiently through these tiers to ensure more reward variety.\nSupplementary info: Before, there would be a limited amount of chances to get rewards within certain tiers as the mission time progressed. Now, with the tier cycling, this means after the 20 minute mark you will have more chances to earn rewards from all tiers.\n\n\nChanged tooltip ‚ÄúView Warframe Profile‚Äù to ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù.\n\nTweaked Contact to delay showing you the in-session icon until the session details are available and you can attempt to join them\n\nFixes:\n\n\nNyx‚Äôs Absorb will now go affect enemies behind walls or cover.\n\nFixed Nyx‚Äôs absorb not doing damage to Infested Crawlers and Chargers.\n\nFixed issues with whisper awareness while in game. Incoming private messages are now shown in squad chat as well as in their own tab.\n\nFixed Volt Chassis dropping instead of Volt Chassis Blueprint.\n\nFixed Grineer sawblade residing in the heads of the Anti Moa. We know the Corpus are trying to save money wherever possible, but their imports of Grineer Parts has caused them much embarrassment.\n\nFixed Valkyr‚Äôs Warcry being permanent on enemies.\n\nFixed Soul Punch not ragdolling enemies.\n\nFixed issues with only Hellions and Eviscerators spawning on Phobos Survivals.\n\nFixed issues where ‚ÄúCeiling Fish‚Äù would occur in Dojo. This marks the end of Ceiling Fish‚Äôs times of horseplay.\n\nFixed issue where users Keys would not show up in menu if the game suffered very low frame-rate.\n\nFixed issues with Vauban‚Äôs Vortex causing crashes when dealing damage.\n\nFixed enemies being stationary on Xini.\n\nFixed issues where equipping ¬†2 mod cards with same elemental damage messes up the compound types created\n\nFixed issues where enemies would not ragdoll for Clients.\n\nImprovements to issues with in-game chat. Progress ongoing.\n\n\nAre you experiencing crashes or other game-breaking issues like freezes or hangs? Please visit our support.warframe.com desk for assistance.

  "fixes": "7.7.1 Hot-Fix + \"About Last Night...\":\nSome of you may have noticed our change lists from yesterday were incomplete (/sarcasm).\nWhile we are apt to make controversial changes in Warframe until the end of time, it is our intention to be upfront about it*. How else would I maintain this supple flame-singed hue? We are formalizing how the changelists are compiled in the future. We will never be perfect, but we can do better.\nHere is what 7.7.1 has as well as important notes absent from the prior update:\n-Chat server upgraded to allow moderation, unified authentication and blunt the hacking attempts.\n-Increased the curve of AI damage/shields for higher level enemies... but then:\n-After more testing, toned down those same curves for high level enemies (split the difference).\n-Reduced simultaneous enemy counts when playing Solo.\n-Restored missing sounds (Hek).\n-Rollback frame-rate dependency fixes for automatic weapons (too much fallout, but this is fixed properly soon).\n-Added more blueprints to Alerts (Alt helmets, Weapon skins).\n-Increase health, shields and regeneration on Cryo-casket in Defense Mode.\n-Rare Mods are now... rare. Faction drop tables were boosting probabilities past Common in some cases.\n-Fix gear becoming unequipped after relogin/return from mission.\n-Fix default Exalibur appearing on title screen.\n-Removed work-in-progress loadout preset option (incomplete).\n*-excluding things we want to surprise you with.\nAbout turn-around time: We do not have moderation and customer support 24/7. I think it is heading that way, but it's not there yet. Try to temper \"Wtf no dev response!\" with that in mind.\nAbout chat: Chat moderation is ad-hoc, but if you're being a jerk we will warn you, kick you, ban you, then suspend your account. Remember the Tenno ways. Humor and Honor are not mutually exclusive.\nAbout difficulty: We are planning more difficulty choice to sidestep the Goldilocks problem here. As much as you think the game is too easy or too hard there is always someone who feels the opposite. Internally we felt the early-game was too hard, the end-game a bit too easy. The longer-term fix is to give players choice since one size does not fit all.\nNext: Bug fixes of course! This goes in tandem with new hotness. In the next few weeks expect tileset expansion, new weapons and more crazy Mods. Update 8 (dramatic cue: \"Rise of the Warlords\") has also begun which will be a leap forward for Warframe and breathe a sense of life and purpose into Warframe Clans.\n(Also note the absurd number scheme, don't take 7.7.x as 8 being just around the corner... it is not)\n",
