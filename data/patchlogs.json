  "additions": "Added new Elite Shield Lancers to Asteroid, Forest, Shipyard and Galleon missions that have level 25+ Grineer.\nAdded new “hit reaction” animations to Grineer enemies!\nBefore this change Grineer would only “flinch” when attacked \nNow, with the updated hit reactions, it’ll be much easier to see when an enemy has been hit. These hit reactions are also much more dynamic to improve your Grineer crushing experience. \nAdded “Browse Wares' ' option to Onkko (Cetus), Roky (Fortuna), and Little Duck (Fortuna).\nWe removed the extra click required to get to their offerings! Instead of having to select “The Quills’ Standing” and then “view offerings”, you now have the option to do so right away. We also updated all mentions of “View Offerings” to “Browse Wares”.\n \nAdded a “Trading Policy” that will appear when Trading for the first time! Safe trading tips have also been added to the Trade UI.\nTrading is an essential part of Warframe and we felt it important to inform players on how to proceed with trading in a safe manner. All players will be presented with the “Trading Policy” window when trading for the first time ever (Mastery Rank 2 players who have just unlocked trading), and for the first time since downloading the update. This applies to any instance of trading in the Dojo and in Maroo’s Bazaar. Once you’ve accepted the Policy you may access it from the “Trading Policy” button when trading if desired. \n \nAdded a ‘COMPANION INVINCIBILITY’ option in the Simulacrum! \n \nAdded an AkLex Conclave Skin to Teshin’s Conclave Offerings!\nAdded the following categories to the Arsenal stat damage section:\n“Damage” or “Damage / Projectile”. \nTotal damage counts that takes multishot into consideration. \n“Status” for weapons with built-in multishot will now read “Status / Projectile”.\n \nAdded a new sound to the Staticor to indicate that it is fully charged!\nAdded a new explosive sound to the Javlok’s alt fire!\nNote from the sound team: We've been working on an exciting addition to the master mix of Warframe! We now have a compressor/limiter/clipper on the output. What does this mean? The game will sound tighter, punchier, more focused, and more in control. This video is lo-res but it gives you a taste (be sure to unmute for this!)\n",
  "changes": "There are 3 situations players may find themselves in:\nHaven’t started Rising Tide. Anyone just beginning will have fully new reduced BP costs.\nHas started Rising Tide. Anyone with any progress at all gets 1x Rush Repair Drone, and will transition to new costs on the next Stage. Any old costs will be refunded. \nRising Tide Complete. Anyone with a complete quest gets 2x Rush Repair Drone. All cost differences will be refunded.\nhttps://forums.warframe.com/topic/1171890-warframe-revised-railjack-onboarding-changes-megathread/\nAdded a new Crewship in Veil Proxima missions: Exo Skold Crewship! It is a variant of the Gokstad but it has an impenetrable shield \nyou’ll have to get crafty to figure out how to take it down, Tenno. \nAdded a ‘Forge All’ button on the Railjack Payload screen in the Dry Dock.\nAvionics Screen no longer uses ‘Hold to Confirm’. \nIntrinsics Screen no longer uses ‘Hold to Confirm’. \nAvionics that are over capacity will now appear as “disabled” instead of being outright removed. \n \nIn a continued effort to avoid getting downed in Railjack situations you can’t control:\n4 seconds of invulnerability will be given when entering a Crewship via the Archwing Slingshot.\n2 seconds of invulnerability will be given when using context actions and the Omni Recall.\nDisabled migrations during Railjack level transitioning (Void tunnel) to avoid putting new Host in completely broken states.\nDisabled ability to enter the Archwing Slingshot while in a level transition (Void tunnel) due to loading into the Railjack mission in many broken states. \nImproved Railjack Grineer Fighter variety across all 3 Proxima regions.\nThe way the levels were set up on the various Grineer Fighters, some of the nodes had level ranges that were too high for all the varieties to appear (The Elite varieties on Earth never spawned for example). So we re-adjusted the level ranges for the various Grineer fighters (Kosma, Gyre, Exo) across all 3 regions , so that there was a better spread of the different fighter types across the nodes. In other words, the lower level nodes of a region will spawn the basic fighter types and then as the difficulty of the nodes progress the Elites are slowly introduced. \nWhen a Railjack mission completes, downed/dead players will be Revived and all Revives will be reset. Allowing you and your squad to continue on your Railjack journey instead of having to return to the Dry Dock.\nThis fixes staying stuck in spectator mode in all Railjack missions if all Revives have been used up.\nQuick Meleeing with the Omni tool in hand will no longer unequip the Omni. This is now consistent with other Gear items, like Fishing/Mining. \nIn an effort to increase stat exposure and reduce clickthrough scenarios, we’ve made some changes to how Railjack Armament stats are displayed:\nRailjack Armament stats now show up below the description in the info popup without having to navigate to the second tab. \nUpon selecting an Armament that is not equipped, the UI will display it’s comparison stats with your current equipped weapon side by side.\n \nYou can now scrap as much Wreckage as desired when prompted due to being at max capacity before missions instead of just the minimum amount.\nWe found it quite cumbersome to have to go back to the Railjack Configure panel in the Dry Dock to clear out your Wreckage inventory over and over again. The previous implementation forced players to run into this prompt often and could cause them to fail loading into a mission (or worse causing instant migrations if Host). This new implementation prevents this issue from occurring and gives more freedom on how much Wreckage to clear outside of the Configure panel. \nEnemy Crewships will now take on the Health and Armor values of the player’s Railjack when hijacked. \nShield values do not apply here as Grineer enemies do not have Shields. \nThe Tunguska Cannon will now fire on release instead of auto firing immediately after charge is complete.\nAfter 3 seconds of holding the charge, the Cannon will auto fire. This brief time allows you to have more control over where you want that cannon fire to land. \nAdded “Sigma” category to sort through Sigma series Components and Armaments in your Railjack Configure panel. \n \nImproved the wing cam when using the Tactical Map \nit should be much more instant when transitioning! \nIncreased Railjack’s Energy tube material brightness to make it a bit more obvious with darker tints. \nChanged material tinting across all Railjack Skins so that it matches and is more consistent with the base Railjack. \nImproved the Crewship meltdown FX so that it is more obvious from the exterior. \nAvionics that are incompatible with the selected Grid slot will be auto listed at the bottom and appear greyed out to avoid confusion as to why it can’t be equipped. \nArmaments/Components that are equipped in the selected slot are now marked as \"equipped\", Armaments/Components equipped in other slots are still marked as \"equipped on X\". This directly correlates to the below fix:\nFixed Railjack Armaments/Components UI not displaying the correct name of the selected Armament/Component when Scrapping, resulting in accidental Scrapping of your equipped Armament/Component. As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1161611-railjack-weapon-management-ui-bug/\nImproved performance of enemy fighter markers in Railjack missions. \nFixed Railjack Clients crashing aboard the Missile Platform after destroying the core.\nFixed a loss of functionality for Clients upon loading into a Railjack mission.\nMore specifically, this issue would result in the Client appearing to skate around instead of walk, hold an invisible weapon, and getting completely stuck when mounting a Turret.\nFixed progression stopping bug if a Host migration occurred after the first radiator has been exposed on a Pulse Turbine POI, and players then proceed to destroy the exposed radiators.\nAfter the Host migration, both radiators would be visible and vulnerable, at which destroying both of them would leave the mission broken due to having nothing to destroy after hacking the second console for the second radiator.\nFixed loading into a Railjack mission from friends Orbiter leaves Client screen black.\nFixed Clients having no Archwing if the Railjack mission was launched after being invited to an Orbiter. As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1163690-nsw-bug-collection-as-of-2705/\nFixed falling in an endless void after using the Archwing Slingshot as a Client into an exploding Crewship and attempting to leave the ship. \nFixed Clients experiencing infinite loading when attempting to load into the Dojo from the Star Chart with the Host.\nFixed an edge case where performing a finisher at the moment the Crewship reached metldown punting you back to the Railjack in a very dead state. \nFixed an edge case where using a Turret or doing a finisher in a Crewship when the Omni tool's countdown expired could leave you in a broken state and not recalling you.\nFixed Railjack Breaches sometimes being unrepairable when joining an active mission.\nFixed inability to use certain Intrinsics during a Railjack mission as the Operator. As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1168903-operator-as-rj-pilot-doesnt-have-access-to-intrinsics-abilities/\nFixed Clients sometimes not being able to activate Railjack Battle Avionics. \nFixed ability to gain Railjack Flux Energy for free from killing enemies with a Battle Avionic.\nFixed the Intrinsic skill \"Tactical Efficiency\" (Tactical Rank 6) not modifying the Flux Energy cost of using Battle Avionics in a Railjack mission.\nFixed the Intrinsic skill “Reflex Aim” (Gunnery Rank 10) not snapping the player's targeting reticle to the nearest enemy lead if using a Railjack hit-scan laser weapon. \nFixed inability to use Archwing Sprint if you were crouching/sliding as you exited the Railjack.\nFixed max Ranked Railjack ‘Tether’ Avionic not tethering up to 6 enemies as intended. \nFixed more cases of the never ending tunnel (Willy Wonka flashbacks am I right?) when loading into Railjack missions after 2 players select different nodes at the same time. \nFixed missing markers for Command Link when Piloting or using a Turret. \nFixed the reticle getting stuck on the right side of the screen when you aim down sights while Piloting with Rank 10 Gunnery.\nFixed Railjack Turrets aiming towards the Tether Avionic projectile when cast, causing them to point in weird directions\nFixed Ramsled boarded enemies remaining frozen in place after casting the Tactical Avionic ‘Intruder Stasis’ even after they’ve died. As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1160044-railjack-intruder-stasis/\nFixed Ramsleds not getting affected by Status Effects. \nFixed an issue where Heat Avionics were not being applied correctly. \nFixed description for ‘Void Cloak’ in The Tactical Menu not displaying the correct cooldown time if Tactical Rank is 7+.\nFixed being able to close the Tactical Menu with its hotkey during “Recall Warp” which caused further attempts to use “Recall Warp” to no longer function.  \nFixed gaining max Health and Shields, Power Strength and presumably any other Archwing-specific bonuses while using Titania’s Razorwing mode in Railjack.\nThis is due to the Intrinsic Ranks that grant Archwing bonuses ( Vigilant Archwing, Vengeful Archwing, etc). These only apply to your true Archwing, not tiny fairy mode.\nFixed projectile speeds of certain Armaments causing bandwidth issues for Clients.\nFixed getting stuck on alt camera angle while piloting Railjack. This also fixes the issue of losing HUD when swapping back to Piloting view after being at an alt angle. \nFixed Void Hole appearing offset if activated by a Client who is Piloting the Railjack.\nFixed being equipped with your Parazon or completely unarmed if you use the Crafting Forge in your Railjack while your Omni Tool or Scanner is equipped. \nFixed several issues when entering the transportation tubes in the Sentient Anomaly: \nFixed automatic weapons continuously firing while traveling in the tube. \nFixed issues with staying in the tube if attempting to move around in all kinds of directions. \nFixed Operators in Void Mode speed running in the tube (gotta go fast?). \nFixed issues with getting stuck in the Pause menu while traveling in the tube. \nFixed inability to use Transference after spamming Transference while trying to exit the Railjack.\nFixed crash when using Transference at the same time as entering the Railjack Slingshot. \nFixed loading into the Archwing Slingshot with an Arch Gun active, causing players to fire the Arch Gun instead of hurling their Warframes out of the Slingshot. \nFixed Companion Pets sometimes being gigantic on the Railjack.\nFixed your Warframe having disjointed hips when Bullet Jumping into the Forward Artillery.\nFixed cases of the Asteroid Base being invisible in Railjack unless you had geometry detail set to High.\nFixed Avionic and Salvage pickup markers at times not showing distance values.\nFixed inconsistent Crewship meltdown timers if you had numerous Crewships in meltdown mode.\nFixed being put in a broken state when attempting to execute a Crewship pilot at the same time as the Crewship enters meltdown mode.  \nFixed some edge cases where players could get stuck when trying to pilot an enemy Crewship that is in meltdown mode. \nFixed a rare case where your weapons function as Unmodded when boarding an enemy Crewship as a Client.\nFixed projectiles from stolen Crewship looping around in a circle before disappearing. \nFixed a script error that could occur if you executed the pilot of an enemy Crewship just as it was exploding. \nFixed the Exo Skold Crewship not using the Crewship marker shape. \nFixed mission objective UI appearing and overlapping the Options menu when you pause the game while using a Turret in the Railjack or stolen Crewship.\nFixed projectile Armaments like the Apoc or Cryophon ignoring the gigantic rocks in front of enemies and damaging them anyways. \nFixed a ‘Hold to Revive’ prompt appearing outside the top of the Railjack during a Catastrophic Failure. Allowing you to actually revive the Railjack’s Health with that apparently very effective green hand gas.   \nFixed various collision issues in the Railjack that allowed Titania to exit the railjack while in Razorwing.\nFixed missile-distraction abilities from Odonata and Elytron being ineffective against missiles that stop tracking halfway in Railjack missions. This notably affects the long-range Grineer Crewship missiles (not the shorter range cannons, which aren't homing).\nFixed scaling issue with the Imperator Vandal’s muzzle smoke FX in Railjack missions. \nFixed Railjack Glyphs sometimes appearing when inside the Archwing Slingshot.\nFixed not seeing your custom (and probably so cool and not a pun) Railjack name when viewing the Railjack while in Archwing.\nFixed a copy of your Warframe being created after selecting the Dry Dock as Operator and Transferring back to Warframe. This also fixes issues of having a bunch of sentient Excalibur Umbras running around. \nMore fixes towards broken Dry Docks when some players have different progression into the Rising Tide Quest.\nPotential fix towards Clients unable to exit the Railjack once back in the Dry Dock from a mission.\nFixed Operators taking on the color scheme of the Railjack interior after exiting any of the turrets in the Railjack. \nFixed Clients not seeing Host’s Railjack customizations (colors and Skin). \nMore fixes towards scrolling back to top issue when contributing or rushing a Railjack weapon or component. Now when you contribute or rush the window will remain where the item is as to not force you to search for it again. \nFixed Railjack Configure UI screen overlapping with the Trading window when invited and accepting to trade in the Dojos. This also fixes being unable to accept invites while on the Intrinsics menu. \nFixed an issue where a \"Select All\" option was appearing in the Railjack Scrap menu, but had no functionality.\nFixed a black shadow replacing one of the Wreckage icons when selecting MR tabs in the Railjack Configure panel. \nFixed Wreckage having to be deselected and reselected to show available options after you previously Contributed to it.\nFixed Scrapping equipped Reactor causing issues with re-equipping Avionics that were auto-unequipped to fit back under capacity. \nFixed selecting ‘Ask Me Later’ on the over capacity Wreckage prompt causing a long delay.\nFixed missing warning when attempting to Trade an already equipped Avionic. \nFixed some cases where the Grid in the Railjack Configure panel would show less elements than intended. \nFixed inability to use the ‘Change Loadout’ button functionality in the Railjack Navigation screen when anchored in the Dry Dock.\nFixed Rank checkmarks in the Intrinsic Details list not automatically updating after you’ve Ranked up.\nFixed the new chosen colours of your Railjack not saving if you go into the Payload screen right after changing colours.\nFixed Client players UI Theme color persisting on screen if said player is viewing the Payload, Avionic or Intrinsics screen when the Host launches a mission.\nFixed Platinum price of Glyphs/Railjack Skin displaying when hovering over the already purchased and selected Glyph/Railjack Skin in the Customization screen.\nFixed Railjack Customization UI lingering after purchasing and equipping a Railjack Skin. \nFixed selecting the Companion loadout in the Railjack Arsenal starting from a black screen and moving to the Companion station in the Dojo. \nFixed Dry Dock docking clamps disappearing at certain angles form viewed from inside the top level of the Railjack.\nFixed Codex missing descriptions for the Exo Raider, Exo Raider Carver, and Exo Raider Eviscerator. \nFixed missing localization when loading into the “Railjack Key Mission” in the Rising Tide Quest. It is now properly localized to “INVESTIGATE COORDINATES ON LUA”. \nFixed a script error as well as a case where some of the effects of the Forward Artillery gun in Railjack lingered forever if you started and stopped charging it very rapidly.\nFixed the banners in the Dry Dock near the entrances not using the Clan Emblem. \nMade fixes towards POI marker inconsistencies. \nPotential fix for a script error that occured when collecting loot in a Railjack POI.\nFixed script error with host migration after exiting Railjack. \nFixed unlocalized Avionics.\nFixed a couple cases of Grineer Mines being unlocalized.\nAdded two new Railjack pilot control options that, when set, the look input will only turn the Railjack and will not affect your crosshair. To enable/disable go to Options > Controls > Scroll down to “Railjack”:\nPilot Centered Crosshair (Mouse)\nPilot Centered Crosshair (Controller)\nYou are already familiar with the enabled state of this option as it was the previous default and only crosshair option when using a controller. Now, when you disable this option when using a controller, the left stick will move your Railjack (forward/back/side to side), and the right stick will now allow you to freely move the reticle across the screen. \nRailjack Pilot Cenetered crosshair_1.mp4\nIncreased the smooth time for non-centered reticles while piloting/using turrets in the Railjack with a controller.  \nFixed missing bumper functionality when cycling through Components and Armaments categories in the Configure Railjack panel when using a controller. \nFixed both the \"on\" and \"off\" state of the Railjack Ability Menu not getting bound to the Custom Ability Menu keybind when using a controller. As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1167262-railjack-keybind-missing/\nFixed an issue where rebinding the Ability Menu in the Railjack tab controller options would allow you to open it with the new binding, but force you to use the default binding to close it. Rebinding the Ability Menu will now use the new binding to open and close it. \nFixed customizing your Railjack controller controls always showing them as their default button regardless of the changes. \nFixed “Vector Maneuver” and “Drift Maneuver” not functioning as intended (only boosting) when using a controller. \nFixed an issue where performing a Dodge while piloting Railjack with a controller would only ever cause it to lunge downwards. \nFixed seeing <SECONDARY_FIRE> when piloting the Railjack after selecting Controller Icon Set as autodetect with a Playstation controller.\nFixed Blink not working with controller users who have never customized their controls (ie. using defaults). \nFixed custom Railjack controller bindings not applying to hijacked Crewship turrets.\nFixed ability to endlessly descend the Railjack by holding down the controller bumpers while Piloting.\nFixed “Search” and “Show Ranked” being bound to the same button when using a controller, causing priority issues on selecting in the Avionics screen.\nFixed an issue where “Move Up/Down” couldn’t be rebound in Railjack controller options.\nFixed excessive “rise/fall” sound triggering when Piloting Railjack with a controller. \nFixed script error when equipping Armaments onto your Railjack when using a controller.\nRequiem Murmurs from failing a Kuva Lich Parazon stab will now again be shared with the entire squad! \nIf we take a trip down memory lane, we’ll arrive at The Old Blood: Hotfix 26.0.5, where we fixed all players receiving Kuva Lich Requiem Murmur progress whenever someone in the squad failed to kill their Kuva Lich. Our intentions to have the Kuva Lich tied exclusively to the respective player were genuine, but the feedback has shone light on what is a worthwhile feature for the Kuva Lich system given its pace towards success. We have bigger plans for Liches for connecting them to other Systems, but this change is the only one ready for Mainline! \nAdded fancy new FX when Valence Fusion has been successfully completed! \nThe Kuva Lich section of the Codex now has tabs for Active, Vanquished, Converted, and Traded Liches!\nDecreased the chances of Kuva Lich controlled sectors forcing an Exterminate situation to allow for more gamemode chances. \nFixed Clients unable to use the ESC pause menu after Parazon stabbing a Kuva Lich.\nFixed the Kuva Nukor, Kuva Hind, and Kuva Bramma weapon progression showing as complete in the Codex when at Rank 30 instead of it’s true completed Rank of 40.\nFixed only 1 Kuva weapon maintaining its innate bonus damage attribute and respective Kuva Lich name when claiming multiple Kuva weapons using the ‘Claim All’ button in the Foundry. \nThis retroactively fixes the Kuva weapons that lost out on their innate bonus damage by giving them back their random buff. Unfortunately, the Kuva Lich name can’t be easily associated with the Kuva weapon, so these fixed weapons will have the default Kuva weapon name (Kuva Tonkor, Kuva Bramma, etc). \nFixed Kuva Larvling not spawning Kuva Lich if downed before Host migration and captured after Host migration. \nFixed becoming stuck on a Rampart after Parazon stabbing your Kuva Lich on it.

Slash Status still bypasses Armor. \nToxin Damage used to apply to Armor with a 25% bonus. Now it is neutral. For role distinction, Toxin bypasses Shields (but not Armor) where as Slash Status bypasses Armor but not Shields.\nPlayer Shields, Health, and Armor used to be shared with all AI, so they had all the weaknesses and resistances that their AI counterparts did.\nNow Players have their own unique Shield, Health, and Armor type classified as TENNO! These have all weaknesses and resistances neutralized (for now). Player Shields now reduce 25% of incoming damage. Player Shields now recharge with custom player-only logic. Shield recharge delays are based on depleted or partial depleted shields. Partially depleted shields (any amount) is a 1 second recharge delay. Full depletion is a 4 second recharge delay.\nThese changes to Player shields are in addition to coming Shield Gating changes, which you can read about in our Shield Gating section!\nWhy: Armor Scaling and enemy Damage Reduction was the nucleus for this change. For years Tenno have had the tools to deal with these things, but the tools were uniform: Use Corrosive Projection, or else. While this is a simplification, it removed the feeling of choice. With these changes, we hope players experience a feeling of variety and choice when taking on enemies.

This reasoning is one of past inconsistency and time determining intent. There are a lot of builds that specialize the use of two Arcanes, but we want to encourage a variety instead of duplication. Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nhttps://forums.warframe.com/topic/1171899-warframe-revised-arcane-changes-megathread/\n\n\nThe degrees of Self-Interrupt start with a small stumble all the way to full knockdown depending on how close you are to the center of explosion.

By pressing ‘Jump’ at the correct time, you can execute a ninja-skill-based knockdown recovery to ALL in-game knockdowns. This ninja recovery window is indicated by a glowing FX on your Warframe.\nStagger Video (slo mo on recovery).mp4\nIn addition to Self Damage being removed, some of the more powerful AOE weapons without Self Damage presently will have the Stagger added, but it should only be noticeable in cases of extreme inaccuracy on the player’s part. The Weapons include:\nKuva Chakkurr\nOpticor\nOpticor Vandal\nBattacor\nSimulor\nSynoid Simulor\nFerrox\nAstilla\nShedu\nKuva Seer\nCyanex\nStaticor\nPox\nTombfinger\nGranmu Prism\nExard Scaffold\nIn the original Dev Workshop, we said:As a result of this overall systemic change, Weapons with Stagger will be getting approximately a 20% buff in Damage, with any weapons with AOE receiving a 50% Radial Damage Falloff from central impact.\nThis is no longer accurate after continued testing. What we are doing now is:\nNo damage buffs have been added, but any weapons with AOE are receiving ~20% increase in Radius. Additionally, AOE weapons are receiving a 90% Radial Damage Falloff from central impact. This means on the very outer section of the explosion Radius 10% of the Damage will be dealt. Tactics will be deadly \naim true, Tenno.\nWhy: Several players brought up the history of the Tonkor and we want to make sure we ship this change in a place that’s conservative in its starting point from a balance perspective. The complete removal of Self Damage does change the pace of destruction with some of the game’s most powerful weapons, so we want to make sure we can iterate upwardly instead of releasing a bonanza of explosions with no other choices.\nWith the removal of Self Damage, Cautious Shot Mod has been changed to be Rifle compatible and reflect the new Stagger mechanic:\n+90% chance to reduce the Stagger effect from self-imposed Radial Attacks.\nhttps://forums.warframe.com/topic/1171900-warframe-revised-removing-self-damage-stagger-megathread/\n\nWhy: This change will bring Excavation in line with existing mission types that have scaling properties after several years of having flat values.

For example,‘Memphis’ on ‘Phobos’ will have its 500, 1,000, 1,500 Credit Caches removed, as well as the 15 and 50 Endo. This will only leave the 2,000 Credits Cache, and the 100 Endo drop for each category, with a drop chance of the sum of all prior denominations.\nWhy: This is more of a Review and clean up for some of the less-rewarding aspects of missions. Right now the base Solar Map nodes exist to progress from planet to planet, while providing either general rewards (Mods, Credits) or specific return rewards (Ivara, Nidus, etc). By getting rid of the lower value items on the general rewards, people playing for the first time should come across a bit of a bump in their resources and credits.

This means if you have a Shot with 200% Status Chance modded with both Blast and Toxin Damage, that single shot will result in both Status Effects!\nIt is worth noting we are fixing a UI inconsistency that is ‘Display Only’. Right now the Arsenal shows Status Chance affected by Multishot, which makes reading the new >100% value confusing. For example, the Arsenal might say 120% but really the Status Chance is 80%. We don’t have Multishot affect any Critical Stats (Chance or Multiplier), so we are fixing this display inconsistency. Multishot now has its own Stat.\nShotguns have a unique Role here based on a very patch-work history with how they interact with Status Chance. A Shotgun that shoots 99% Status Chance would give you 35% (roughly) status per pellet. 100% Status Gives you 100% Status per pellet. This huge jump in performance happens with just a 1% gain \nwhy? Well, to answer that we have to look at our choice to make what the UI conveys reality. It would feel broken to shoot a Shotgun with 100% Status and not see a perfect spread of Effects. In reality, to make Status consistent we have to treat Shotguns as a special case.\nShotguns as a special case means we have buffed the Status Chance of all Shotguns by x3 or greater. The UI now behaves to show the reality that you are determining Status Chance per pellet.\nThis section will outline exactly what this means for each Status type, including information on how multiple Status Effects behaved with stacking prior to this Hotfix:\nPlayers \naka Tenno \ncan only have a Maximum of 1 Stack on them \nyou cannot receive Stacked Status Effects as a player from enemies, fear not!\nWhy: The inclusion of enhanced or different stacking of Duplicate Status Effects is one to refresh the appeal of Status.\nIn addition, we’ve removed 0.25x Multiplier for Elemental Status Effects, meaning all Elemental Status Effects are 4x more likely.\nWhy: Critical has long been king \nand while we are leaving Critical as is, our goal is to bring Status into the Arsenals in a new light for all Primary, Secondary, and Melee weapons. Our long-term goal with this change is to build upon this series of changes to eventually allow Status to impact bigger threats like Liches and Eidolons.\nhttps://forums.warframe.com/topic/1171911-warframe-revised-100-status-chance-shotgun-megathread/\n\nCorrosive Projection, Shield Disruption and Infested Impedance new Rank values are:\nUnranked: -3% \nRank 1: -6% \nRank 2: -9% \nRank 3: -12% \nRank 4: -15% \nRank 5: -18%\nWhy: We think being consistent is key. Passively removing 100% of an enemy's defenses is not an interesting choice, and we were completely inconsistent in this regard with Auras (i.e the efficacy of 4x Corrosive Projections vs 4x Shield Disruptions).\nRifle Aptitude increased from 15% Status Chance to 90% Status Chance\nMelee Prowess increased from 15% Status Chance to 90% Status Chance\nSure Shot increased from 15% Status Chance to 90% Status Chance\nShotgun Savvy increased from 30% Status Chance to 90% Status Chance\nWhy?

There is also a brand new ‘Leverian’ section specifically for the Codex that you can access the respective Warframe’s Leverian!\nThe Quest section of the Codex now orders itself in Active > Incomplete > Complete to reduce having to scroll through alphabetical order.\nChanged the Focus Convergence in-world marker to a lighter yellow color so it isn't as easily confused with the main objective marker. \nRemoved “Exterminate enemies” stage in Sortie Spy missions. This was done to fix some issues related to being unable to complete the mission due to this stage appearing. \nMade improvements towards a hang that could occur when selecting “Appearance” in the Arsenal to improve performance. \nIncreased the frequency in which missions from the Void appear as Void Fissures. \nRemoved camera shake and color correction for other players in your squad when firing the Kuva Bramma for less eye bleed! \nUpdated the Mastery Test UI screen with more information and style!\n \nUpdated loading screen with a fancy new diamond loader and updated the loading screen tip font! \nNew Loading Screen.mp4\nUpdated the ‘Network Not Responding’ icon to be more jazzy and on brand!\n \nSignificantly increased the chance for the Juggernaut to drop Pherliac Pods Blueprint from 10% to 90%.\nIncreased the max Waypoint range from 100 to 250 meters. \nIn addition to the Revive screen receiving the ‘Hold to Confirm’ Revive/Abort function, we’ve made a few other changes/fixes when in spectator mode after an unfortunate death:\nThe Squad panel, minimap, and HUD trackers will now be visible during your time spectating. \nThe spectator camera now also follows the movement of the player’s camera more closely. \nYou can spectate the other fallen corpses of your Allies.\nFixed missing controller bindings callouts in the spectator screen.\nFixed an issue with the \"current target\" icon not always appearing over the name of the player actually being spectated.\nDisruptions missions will no longer be eligible Syndicate missions below level 15, as Demolysts don’t spawn at that level, thus an inability to complete the mission. \nPalladino’s Riven Mod Offering screen now also includes the option to purchase Riven Mods Slots!  \n \nYou can now equip Veiled Kitgun Rivens on your Primary!\nThis feature is in preparation for Primary Kitguns coming in the Scarlet Spear update!\nReduced the pulsing FX frequency and size on the Eidolon Vomvalysts in their energy form. \nBaruuk’s Reactive Storm Augment Mod will now also apply its Status Chance and damage type matching to enemy weakness on Serene Storm’s AOE attacks. \nPreviously the Augment was only applying to close-combat attacks \nwe decided to extend this to Serene Storm’s AOE waves to give more flexibility to the Augment’s use. We'll be monitoring the change as you play and test it for any potential adjustments.\nUpon review, the falloff range for a few Arch-Guns were not consistent with what the Arsenal was displaying. The changes below fixes these issues:\nIncreased the speed of Corvas and Fluctus projectiles to fix them dying before reaching their intended falloff ranges.\nIncreased the Grattler projectile lifetime so it can reach its intended falloff range.\nIvara Prime’s starry night FX when invisible will apply to any form of invisibility, not just her abilities (Prowl, Cloak Arrow). \nThis fixes other invisibility FX sources (for example: Untraceable and Ghost Mods) stacking with hers and looking awful/causing performance issues. \nRemoved Security Cameras and Turrets in Corpus Ship survival missions.\nDuring an optimization pass we realized these environment hazards in Survival missions were extra AI overhead and annoyances when there’s already a lot going on. \nSignificantly reduced the damage of slide attacks for dual swords in the Conclave.\nAfter reviewing how slide attacks perform with dual swords vs. other weapons, we determined it far exceeded them and needed to be rebalanced.\nMade some minor UI tweaks in Survival missions to improve readability.\nProjectiles from Crossbows equipped with the Dali Ballistica Skin will now match the Skin. \nUpdated naming conventions for Dojo Decorations. For example: “Small Topiary Bush” is now “Topiary Bush (Small)”. \nMade adjustments to the brightness of trees in the Orokin Moon tileset. \nChanged Nova’s Molecular Prime casting FX to have better positioning.\nThe Grineer Shield Lancer has been given a brand new reload animation! \nUpdated the reload animation for the Miter to better suit its uniqueness. \nKuva Lich and Ayatan Star in-world markers will start to fade as you approach them within certain distances:\nKuva Lich: At 20m marker will begin fade\nAyatan Star: At 5m marker will begin fade\nReduced overall transmission frequency in Survival missions. \nUpdated the Survival tower icon for in-world markers so that it matches the objective UI. \n \nIncreased the Health and Damage Resistance on Simaris’ Sanctuary Targets so that they don’t get accidentally nuked while attempting to scan them. \nReduce volume/ radius of Domestic Drones in Orbiter.\n",

Today, that changes!\nIf you watched Devstream #136, the 2019 Player Survey showed us that out of the 27,000+ responses, the Kuva Lich system was the 2019 addition that was enjoyed the least. Many players voiced that the Kuva Lich system got progressively less fun the more time and energy was devoted to it. While finding the line between repetition and progress is one Warframe has struggled with since it’s first day, Liches highlighted some issues we aim to address while walking that line.\nA downed Kuva Larvling will now display an icon of the Kuva weapon that it’s birthed Kuva Lich will possess!\nThis allows players to decide upfront if they want to pursue that weapon by finishing the downed Kuva Larvling, or to ignore and attempt another Lich. The Kuva Larvling will be in this downed state for a max of 30 seconds before it perishes.\n\nYour Kuva Lich will no longer kill you when you fail a Requiem guess, nor will they attempt to break your back. The Parazon stabbing animation will play but the UI will show whether it was a success or failure. Upon receiving a Requiem fail, your Kuva Lich will laugh at you and leave, leaving your back and dignity intact!\n\nYour Kuva weapon duplicates now offer a gradual progression towards a “perfect” Kuva weapon, which would reflect a 60% damage value, if you choose to pursue this path.\nWe’re also looking at other places we could potentially use this mechanic (Railjack, etc)!\nAs you can see, we’ve cracked a few eggs to make this omelette! We look forward to your feedback on these Kuva Lich changes!\n\n\nIncreased Converted Kuva Lich minimum time to 2 minutes.\nIncreased Converted Kuva Lich Damage Per Second with damage bonus upgrade 3x.\nFixed Converted Kuva Liches not using their abilities.\nDoubled the chance of a Kuva Lich to have a Vengeful Ephemera from 10% to 20%!\nKnown Requiem/attempts now also appear in your Parazon Upgrade screen!\nChanged all Kuva Thrall markers to consistently reflect the new icon brought in 27.0.11. This includes the minimap and when waypointing a Kuva Thrall.\nKuva pickup/rewards are now displayed as the fancy banner UI, similar to Argon.\nKuva Liches can no longer be Parazon stabbed as they are escaping. This resulted in invisible animations, and the UI unveiling if your Requiem Mod guess was correct but not registering it, thus not ranking up your Kuva Lich.\nCleaned up visual metal chunks from the Kuva Liches Carapace (Iron Skin) ability.\nYou can now search the Kuva Lich History Codex section by name, Kuva weapon, and Ephemera.\nFixed Lich ‘Ruse’ clones displaying the default Excalibur Helmet on their shoulder instead of the same Warframe Helmet as their owner. \nFixed Nidus Helmet Armor not appearing grayscale on Kuva Liches.\nFixed certain enemy types being allowed to be spawned as Kuva Thralls that shouldn't be.\nFixed cases of the Kuva Lich ping-ponging between locations when engaging its target.\nFixed script error when changing resolution while in the Kuva Lich screen.\n\n\n\n\nA note from our Sound Team: “We recorded many different real guitars to make this electric guitar Shawzin sound heavy.  The sounds are a result of blending these different guitar tones together. Each of the notes has a couple of different variations so when you play it, it will sound like a realistic electric guitar.”\nOmni tool is now available as a Gear item in your Inventory (Archwing Quest completion required)! This allows you to place the Omni tool in your preferred Gear spot for quick access!\nIf you forget to equip the Omni tool in your Gear upon entering a Railjack mission it will still be given to you for the mission.\nIncreased maximum power for Zekti Predator Avionic to 80%, from 72%\nThis Avionic was slightly under-performing its cheaper Vidar equivalent.\n‘Show Equipped’ will now show ranked Avionics that are equipped even when ‘Show Ranked’ is disabled.\nHijacked Crewships now start the reactor meltdown sequence when they reach zero health.\nOrdnance weapon icons now become translucent while in cooldown, and will reflect a timer icon to better indicate it’s current cooldown state.\nChanged Railjack Engine Component rating stats from Kilometers Per Hour to Meters Per Second to be consistent in the equipped stats.\nFixed Railjack Speed stat showing a higher number than your in-game movement speed.\nThis fix needs some explanation. First of all, a bit of trivia, Railjack operates at a different scale than the rest of Warframe. Perhaps some of you have seen space-time breaking down in the form of truly enormous cats... The Speed that was being shown in the drydock in your ship Stats was in the wrong scale and gave numbers that were inaccurate.  This also caused the bonus given by your engine, displayed in kilometers-per-hour, to be wrong: an engine might say that it gave an extra 30km per hour, but give far far more than that in the Stats if you did the math to convert.  This has been fixed so that: 1) your Stats now show the correct Speed for Railjack's world scale, and, 2) your engines are rated in meters per second which matches up to the Stats.  While it may look like your ship's Speed stat in the drydock has gone down significantly, please try flying around in missions and see how your ship handles. This only fixes how the UI reports the numbers in your Stats. No change to how fast your ship actually moves is intended, and if your ship doesn't fly at the meters-per-second shown in the Stats then it should be carefully measured and reported as a bug.\nFixed the Railjack Forward Artillery not damaging Crewships past their engines. You should find that the Forward Artillery hits harder and your shot isn’t wasted on just destroying the Crewship engines! \nFixed Crewships not recovering after becoming disabled by your Railjack guns.\nFixed Railjack Host being able to use Navigation before the mission is complete and Clients inability to use Navigation at all when launched from the Dry Dock.\nFor clarification, the correct functionality is Host and Client can use Railjack Navigation after mission complete and neither can use Navigation before mission complete.\nFixed enemy Captains spawning in the “Asteroid Base Commander” POI and Commanders spawning in the \"Kill the Galleon Captain\" POI.\nFixed Galvarc Missile Launcher not functioning for Clients.\nFixed Fiery Phoenix not becoming disabled when Flux Energy reaches 0.\nFixed full ranked Flow Burn not being upgraded further when placed into a max rank Grid.\nFixed Battle Avionics remaining disabled for Clients after Railjack is repaired from Critical Breach.\nFixed Dome Charges being consumed when a Client enters the Forward Artillery, regardless of actually firing the BFG.\nFixed issue where Clients would see Forward Artillery reload multiple times while waiting for Host to put Dome Charges in the weapon.\nFixed Clients not seeing Shatter Burst Battle Avionic explosion FX.\nFixed Clients not seeing the missile created by Shatter Burst/Void Hole.\nFixed being left out in space if you were aboard a Crewship when it despawns due to mission completion. \nFixed cases of losing the Railjack Forge UI if you attempted to activate it while sliding.\nFixed Railjack Ammunition and supplies that were spent during a mission not saving at the end of mission.\nFixed losing custom Railjack Skin/Colors if a Host migration occurred and you were the last remaining player. \nFixed Railjack Avionic/Salvage pickups sometimes not showing distance markers.\nFixed the camera breaking when Warping to another player while in the Archwing Slingshot.\nFixed Tactical Menu Chase Camera to better reflect the view of the player’s camera.\nFixed Dry Dock creating a blocking volume in a room that is built below it.\nFixed issues with selecting Veil/Saturn Proxima nodes when using the controller.\nFixed cooldown bar on Railjack Ordnance burst-fire weapons emptying and not start filling until after the laser's done firing, instead of when you initially fire.\nFixed Railjack Tactical Avionics cooldown tooltip information not applying Intrinsic cooldown reductions from Tactical Response and Swift Tactics.\nFixed Void Cloak cooldown timer not updating when viewing in the Tactical Menu.\nFixed Upgraded Avionics not showing their proper description and stats, such as being Ranked vs Unranked.\nOptimizations for the Kuva Fortress tileset. This includes cleaning up wasteful materials, abusive lighting, volumetrics, overdrawn meshes and much more. More optimizations to come!\n \nMade micro-optimizations to a script used in Survival missions.\nImproved performance of the Railjack cannons.\nImproved performance when using the Imperator Vandal in Railjack.\nOptimized runtime lighting in an Earth cave tile.\nOptimized real time lighting in the Jupiter Gas City Index tileset.\nOptimized the Omni tool to fix a hitch when equipping it.\nMade micro-optimizations to a script used for controlling doors. \nMade some micro-optimizations to HUD performance, especially on Railjack.\nMade a micro-optimization to UI performance, including while piloting the Railjack.\nMade a micro-optimization Railjack POI once sub-objectives have been completed.\nMade a micro-optimization to a script that handles fire breaking out on a Railjack.\nMade a micro-optimization to Chroma's Effigy ability.\nMade a micro-optimization to a script used to animate the Dual Kamas.\nMelee Heavy Attacks are no longer able to be triggered by holding 'E', they again live exclusively on Alt-Fire.\nThe loss of Melee Combo Counter feedback due to spamming Melee drove the vast amounts of requests for Melee Heavy Attack to not be holding ‘E’. A toggle for Melee Heavy Attacks is not in the cards, thus Melee Heavy Attacks are now essentially brought back to its original mechanic of having to use Alt-Fire. \nNPCs now have about a second of delay before being able to perceive other players or NPCs that come out of invisibility, regardless of alert state. Previously, combat-state enemies would near instantly retarget in such cases. Seen in:\nRemoved Riven Mods from the Codex Mod section.\nThere were a few issues present here: 1) the Codex Mod section not display all of your Rivens Mods, and, 2) the Riven Mods that it did show would point their acquisition to Cephalon Simaris, which only applies to Companion Weapon Rivens. Considering the extensive amount of Rivens possible, this option in the Codex does not function properly, as it would need to look up unique information.\nAll Gas City, Sanctuary Onslaught, and Elite Sanctuary Onslaught Captura Scenes can now be sold for 3500 Credits for those that have duplicates!\nA fully charged throw of the Orvius will now activate its unique enemy suspension mechanic. \nRestored the original default Energy colors of the Limbo Limina Skin and Nekros Irkalla Skin to match its original artist intentions.\n",

  "changes": "Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.12:\nAs mentioned in 27.0.11, we wanted to implement a more token based system to obtain the Tenebrous Ephemera that we removed from the drop table. An Anomaly Shard is 100% guaranteed at End of Mission for every Sentient Anomaly POI you complete.\nTenebrous Ephemera\nALL Sentient Captura Scenes \nSentient Captura Scenes have also been removed from the drop table and will be purchasable from Little Duck exclusively.\nSharing is caring! Loot gathered when on-foot in a Point of Interest, Crewship, and from killing a Boarding Party are now shared between the whole squad, so you don’t individually need to go collect the loot if you’re busy Piloting, Engineering, etc!\nThis excludes Health, Ammo, and Energy pickups. Also, AFK players do not get the items shared and cannot pick them up later.\nMinor Breaches, Fires, and Electrical traps now restore Railjack Health once again when a Catastrophic Failure breach is active!\nThe Health return was removed in 27.0.10 due to being used to manipulate Railjack invulnerability.\nAdded tips to the \"Configure Railjack\" screen in the Dojo. Simply hover over the \"i\" icon in the bottom right corner to learn more about each category! \nAvionics and Wreckage dropped in Railjack missions will now display a distance marker!\nThe distance marker will appear when the Avionic or Wreckage is near the center of the screen, regardless of how far it is!\nUpdated the ‘Components and Armaments Slots’ description to clarify that they do not apply to Wreckage, only Repaired Wreckage.\nMade a micro-optimization to the Railjack UI. \nFor those wondering: Micro-optimizations means small adjustments were made to improve performance without any changes to the game’s behavior. So you shouldn’t see anything change except that game runs a little faster!\nMade a micro-optimization to a common function used by Railjack game-code.\nMade a micro-optimization to numerous Railjack missions.\nMade a micro-optimization to Railjack lighting.\nMade some micro-optimizations to HUD marker performance, especially on Railjack.\nFixed a crash when the Host aborted from a completed Railjack mission.\nFixed a rare crash if you were connecting to a squad while another player was dealing damage with a Railjack weapon.\nFixed a crash when fighting Sentients in the Sentient Anomaly POI. \nMore fixes towards broken Dry Docks when some players have different progression into the Rising Tide quest.\nFixed cases of Turrets being inoperable if a Host migrates while they were operating it.\nFixed Client bodies disappearing, Railjack turning into just black walls, and more bad states if they were operating a Turret when the Host migrates.\nFixed Clients dying and being Revived when operating a Turret resulting in the Railjack disappearing.\nFixed Clients crashing if the Host migrated during a Critical Breach.\nFixes toward Railjack Fast Travel not working properly while operating a Turret.\nSome issues still persist that we are investigating! \nFixed Wing Turrets moving their positions each time a Client mounts them.\nFixed exiting the Railjack with Hildryn’s Balefire active defaulting you to Unarmed with no Arch-Gun.\nFixed weird camera rotations after launching out of the Archwing Slingshot.\nFixed the Quick Progress screen not being usable after the first node transition in Railjack.\nFixed Lavan Elemental Reduction Avionics gain nothing from being Upgraded to Rank 1 unless on an Upgraded Grid.\nFixed Sentient Cores displaying the wrong marker after being picked up.\nFixed a couple issues of hangar doors on the Missile Platform not opening for Clients.\nFixed a script error when an enemy Crewship deploys their healing bubble.\nFixed a script error in the Railjack UI.\nDefense Waves will now complete if NPCs are downed (but not dead), except for the final Wave, where all NPCs must be taken care of.\nRemoved the hit-scan tracers from Imperator Vandal as it's now a projectile weapon. \nOptimized server-side code for game log-in.\nOptimized enemy Enemy class hierarchy slightly.\nImproved robustness of a script interface to try to avoid scripts breaking if you switched to your Operator at the wrong time.\nMade some systemic optimizations to the script runtime.\nMade some micro-optimizations to the UI system.\nImproved error handling in cache optimizer (some errors like being out of space) would trigger silent abort; it should now properly send you to https://www.warframe.com/en/iofail as intended.\nUpdated the \"Boss Kills\" section of the Profile stats to include 5 years of game updates (untouched since Update 14!).\nNot only does this stat include the updated boss types it now includes special bosses like the Hemocyte and Razorback. There are a few known issues for some bosses that remain.\nHydroid, Limbo, Mesa, and Mirage ability videos have been added to their respective Arsenals!\nIncreased the scan projector FX when Conserving on the Orb Vallis to address colorblind difficulty.\nImproved code-generation for certain types of compiler optimizations.\nFixed a performance regression in some rare cases for Ryzen processors.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed inability to use any Piloting maneuvers due to left stick being bound to zoom, effectively ignoring callouts in Intrinsic details screen.\nFixed the Upgrade screen for Avionics in the Dry Dock missing button callouts for Upgrading when using a controller.\nFixed LTHUMB button worked to activate the Search box even when the picker wasn't visible in the Avionics screen.\nFixed the Left/Right bumpers not functioning in the Avionics Upgrade Screen.\nFixed the Sort menu not working in any of the Avionics screens.\nFixed becoming stuck in the Avionics screen and having to restart the game.\nFixed inability to exit the Avionic Grid Upgrade screen if you place your virtual cursor over a Grid.\nFixed several crashes and hangs on Windows 10 when an audio device is unplugged or changed.\nFixed a rare crash when using Profile > Log Out from the menu.\nFixes towards pathing issues with the Drone in the Plains of Eidolon. This also fixes a very specific spot where the Drone would regularly get stuck. As reported here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/es51n3/cmon_de_its_been_2_years_why_do_we_still_need_a/ \nMost noticeable in Plague Star at the moment, but still existed outside the Operation with Plains Bounties. We’ll continue to check up on this issue.\nFixed the Vengeful Charge Ephemera providing constant light source for Mirage's Eclipse, resulting in a cosmetic granting the light buff to remain 99% of the time.\nFixed Mission Time carrying over from time spent in Dojos or Relays.\nFixed Mission Time including the time spent in your Orbiter after aborting a mission prior.\nFixed your Kuva Lich having the default Excalibur Helmet on their shoulder if you killed the Kuva Larvling as a Client. \nFixed Tactical Reload, Lock and Load, and Eject Magazine Mods not functioning for Clients.\nFixed toggle sprint carrying over into Wukong’s Cloud Walker (normal hold sprint did not).\nFixed Ivara’s Navigator cast animation not being replicated between Host/Client, resulting in no sound or movement.\nFixed the Quellor Alt Fire being silent when it’s meant to be Alarming (as indicated in the Arsenal). \nFixed enemies being immune to Vauban’s Bastille if they were ragdolled out of it previously.\nFixed Excalibur’s Chromatic Blade elemental FX and statistics on Exalted Blade not updating after you change your Energy colour.

  "changes": "Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.11:\nJust like you and your buff New Year resolutions, we’re here with some of ours (although maybe not as buff as yours \nyou’re looking great we must say).\nIntroducing global buffs for all Reactor types found in the wild. Any existing gear you have will simply be adjusted for Avionics capacity, which will automatically be a buff in all cases (note: the Vidar III’s range has been compressed significantly from a 30 -100 range to the new 90 -100 range, but we will not give you lower adjustments if you had a Vidar III Reactor with Avionics capacity values in the 90 -100 range before this change).\nWith these changes, it’s important to note how we got from Point A to B. When initially setting up the Avionics values of these rewards, we did not forsee the depth of the frustration the ranges caused, but in hindsight we should have. Thanks to your feedback, we are able to confidently make broad and major buffs across the board.\nTEMPORARILY removed the Tenebrous Ephemera as a drop from Reinforced Sentient Containers aboard the Sentient Anomaly in Veil Proxima. The drop method is causing numerous issues in terms of connectivity stability and player frustration. We’re going to be changing the acquisition method that won’t involve a direct drop rate in a near future Hotfix/Update, and will instead be closer to a token system (complete X Anomaly missions to buy Ephemera from a vendor).\nThe Tenebrous Ephemera will be coming back as soon as possible in a better acquisition method\nAffinity gained from all Omni tool Repairs and Forge actions aboard the Railjack is now shared with the squad!\nPreviously, only the player who performed the Repair with the Omni tool/Forge action gained Affinity. Now, when any individual completes tasks with the Omni tool or Forge, the Affinity will be shared across all members. This is not restricted to those onboard the Railjack \nthose flying around in your Archwing or taking out Crewships will also benefit. The goal here is to have the efforts of one benefit all and ultimately help each other earn Intrinsics for shared activities that keep the Railjack afloat. \nWreckage limit has been changed to match the existing Riven method in terms of how the limit behaves to the player. Instead of Wreckage being auto-scrapped when over the limit, a prompt will appear upon returning to the Dry Dock that indicates the over limit Wreckage must be dealt with before you can start another Railjack mission.\nWreckage Repairs that are partially funded or waiting for completion (timer not expired yet) can now be cancelled! Resources funded will be returned and the Wreckage will remain in your Inventory to be Repaired or Scrapped later.\n \nKeep in mind this doesn’t change the 80% refund from Scrapping Repaired Wreckage.\nChanged base Avionics so they all have at least one rank to address difficulty knowing which ones you can scrap and which ones you can't, due to the ‘no ranks’ Avionics stacking with all other unrankeds:\nLavan Ablative Shell\nLavan Heat Sink\nLavan Last Stand\nLavan Thermatic\nLavan Phasic Weave\nLavan Predator\nLavan Winged Force\nLavan Winged Steel\nVidar Last Stand\nTo accomodate for the base Avionic change above, other Avionics have been changed: \nVidar Predator: Higher base stat and higher drain\nVidar Winged Steel: Lower drain\nVidar Winged Force: Lower drain\nNumerous UI changes in the name of organization and clarity have been made to the Railjack Research and Configure screens:\nAdded MK category tabs to the Railjack Research screen to better sort and display your growing Inventory of Research.\nAdded Categories, Search Bar, and Sort options to the Railjack Components and Armaments screens.\nAdded a ‘Show Equipped’ and ‘Show Ranked’ option in the Avionics Scrap screen.\nBattle and Tactical Avionic Grids now have Grid category icons to mark which is which.\nIn addition, when picking a Battle Grid, we now reinforce which Grid you are selecting/viewing Avionics for by showing the category name and icon.\nHull Breach that are active when the mission succeeds will be fixed automatically.\nThis addresses missions failing after having already succeeded the mission due to players unable to fix the Hull Breach in time.\nIncreased the Range of Winged Cyclone, Winged Force, Winged Steel, and Winged Storm to 1000m.\nThis also fixes these Archwing based Avionics for Railjack also affecting the Railjack itself.\nIncreased the mount animation speed for the Archwing Slingshot and Wing Turrets.\nToned down the FX for both the Particle Ram and Fiery Phoenix Battle Avionic when aboard the Railjack.\nThis change is being made due to plenty of feedback requesting less visibility-inhibiting FX. \nTo further increase the visibility when a Forge is available for use in the Railjack, the two screens and orange circle above, and activation button will glow when it’s ready and appear off then it’s busy. \n \nReduced the brightness of the Crewship healing bubble burst FX.\nChanged the Railjack entrance UI marker to use the same blue as the Railjack marker in-mission.\nRefining in the Forge Bay with a controller now requires you to click and hold X for 1 second instead of simply clicking X.\nThis addresses accidental Refining due to mashing X to open the Forge window.  \nThe ‘Open Squads’ line now appears at the bottom of the Star Chart Railjack node mission info popup for consistency.\nDepending on the node, it was previously buried in between the Requirements or Rewards lines.\nFixed not gaining Intrinsics after mission completion.\nAn example of this situation would be if the mission succeeded while a Boarding Party was still aboard, but not fully dealt with until after the mission success popup. \nFixed a case of loading a Railjack mission forever due to some players having different progression into the Rising Tide quest.\nFixed Clients being stuck in a permanent streaming tunnel if they were in Dojo and Host in Liset.\nFixed cases of exiting the Archwing Slingshot resulting in a black screen.\nFixed a crash that could occur in Railjack if you were inside an enemy Crewship when it's destroyed.\nFixed Flux Energy that was in the capacity provided by Hyperflux Avionic being lost between Railjack sessions.\nFixed the stat value of Flux Capacity on Reactors showing higher than actual stats.\nWe're using

  "changes": "Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.10:\nWe bring you another Hotfix before the weekend arrives. The first Hotfix of 2020, 27.0.9, brought a slew of Railjack tailored Additions, Changes, and Fixes (among general ones as well), of which we have been reading your initial feedback. Railjack Resource balancing continues to be a hot topic of discussion in regards to the overall Railjack experience. More to come!\nPlayers will now have ~3 seconds of invulnerability when exiting the Railjack or a Point of Interest! \nThis window allows for a moment to escape from the incoming damage aimed close to your location so you don’t fall victim to a one-shot death.\nIncreased the refund from Scrapping repaired Wreckage to 80% from 50%.\nA welcomed increase from feedback that still maintains the risk vs reward of repairing Wreckage, hence why is it not a 100% return.\nRepairing a minor Railjack Breach/Fire/Electrical when a Catastrophic Failure breach is active will no longer give Health back to the Railjack.\nThis addresses numerous cases of Railjack invulnerability abuse by manipulating the Catastrophic Failure breach timer. We’re looking at other ways to allow Health on minor Breach repairs/fires/electrical during a Catastrophic Failure without opening the door to this misuse. \nWreckage capacity now appears in the equip screen for Components and Armaments, allowing you to see how many you currently own while Scrapping.\nDistance values on Railjack enemies will now be displayed once their name is visible.\nUpgraded art quality for certain Grineer Installations in Railjack missions.\nMade some micro-optimizations to the Railjack HUD.\nFixed inability to destroy enemy Crewships that have been hijacked.\nFixed the wide door in the Pulse Turbine not opening for Clients.\nFixed being placed outside of the Railjack level when loading into a Railjack mission from your Orbiter as the Operator.\nFixed control settings such as mouse sensitivity being set to non-Railjack settings when a Crewship is destroyed. \nThis was most noticeable when Piloting the Railjack during the Crewship explosion, as sensitivity would abruptly change until the Pilot seat was dismounted.\nFixed cases of Armament Wreckage unique stats not showing. This was due to the physical Armament not being equipped on the side of the Railjack, which then considered it not equipped.\nFixed Carcinnox Armaments displaying incorrect Falloff ranges in the Dry Dock stats.\nFixed the Munition Ammo count UI in the Railjack displaying 1 more capacity than you actually have (ie 30/31).\nFixed Railjack Forge not applying yield multipliers (Engineer Intrinsic bonus) to displayed craft amounts.\nFixes towards Ram Sleds occurring during a transition to the Dojo after completing a Railjack mission.\nFixed hazard markers (Fire, Electricity, Fast Travel) inside the Railjack appearing in the wrong locations when viewed in the Tactical Menu while on the Pilot seat or side Turrets.\nFixed missing Railjack enemy UI after exiting/returning/exiting the Railjack.\nFixed incorrect minimap overlay when failing a Railjack mission and returning to the Dojo.\nFixed Railjack enemies displaying a Rank of 00.\nFixed a crash while transitioning levels in the Railjack.\nFixed a script error that can occur when exiting the Archwing Slingshot after opening the pause menu, which caused a persistent black screen.\nSome camera issues still persist that we’re investigating.\nFixed some Mods displaying under the Items section on the End of Mission screen.\nFixed Reliquary Drive appearing to have the ‘vacant’ text even after completing the Key quest. \nFixed unlocalized Railjack recall text.\nThe Shedu Blueprint has been added to Cephalon Simaris’ Lost & Found Offerings (only after acquisition Quest completion). \nIncreased range that the Mine Osprey drops mines from. This combined with their behaviour bringing them close to the player meant the Ospreys would only usually get about one mine dropped before hovering harmlessly near the player.\nRemoved decimals in the Arsenal stats if damage Falloff range is 1000 or greater to fix numbers overlapping and appearing messy.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed Jackal and Razorback not correctly turning to face players sometimes when you get behind them.\nFixed Korrudo having inherited the Hirudo’s Health on Critical Hits mechanic.\nFixed the Redeemer weapon series appearing to deal 10x Damage than it actually was.\nThis affected Arsenal stats only, in missions it did the correct damage.\nMore fixes towards Wisp movement animations issues when equipped with the Atmos and Nunchaku.\nFixed incorrect Energy color for the Vengeful Shockwave Ephemera.\nFixed Ivara Prime’s Quiver ability not using her Artemis Bow Prime mesh. As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1160446-ivara-primes-1-doesnt-use-the-right-artemis-bow-texture/\nFixed the Paris Prime arrow using incorrect textures.\nFixed incorrect Energy color on the Hema muzzle flash light.\nFixed overly metallic reflections on the Kopesh Longsword Skin.\nFixed incorrect lightning textures on Volts. As reported here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1160559-bad-lightning-still-not-fixed/\nFixed missing Channeling particle FX on the Targis Prime Armor (appears with x2 Combo Counter).\nFixed seeing a distorted flat circle on the Staticor explosion (and radiation areas).\nFixed incorrect Kubrow eye glow color when using the Metus Fur Pattern.\nFixed Eidolon Lures disappearing at certain camera angles.\nFixed MOA and Kavat Companion Emblems being equipped on the wrong side.\nFixed broken warp sounds in the Sentient tileset.\nFixed a script error related to Tusk Mortar Bombards crouching.\n",

  "changes": "Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.9:\nArmor value changes:\nFlak: 300 to 150\nElite Flak: 350 to 175\nTaktis: 250 to 125\nElite Taktis: 350 to 175\nCutter: 250 to 125\nElite Cutter: 300 to 150\nOutrider: 800 to 300\nElite Outrider: 800 to 400\nHealth value changes:\nFlak health: 250 to 375\nTaktis health: 200 to 300\nCutter health: 200 to 300\nOur intent is to make Railjack weapons more effective on their own. As such, Rhino’s Roar and Saryn’s Toxic Lash no longer unintentionally affect Railjack weapons, as per [DE]Marcus’ post here:\n\nElite Exo Taktis\nElite Kosma Cutter\nElite Gyre Cutter\nElite Exo Taktis\nElite Exo Flak\nElite Exo Cutter\nElite Exo Flak\nElite Exo Cutter\nElite Exo Flak \nAdding Void Hole to Elite Exo Flaks should make it significantly easier to acquire due to their spawn rates, but we will continue to watch all the drops in case they need further changes.\nElite Exo Cutter\nDecreased the effectiveness of the Particle proc but increased its Duration\nReduced to 7.5% damage bonus per hit, still stacks, and lasts 20 seconds. The exponential growth and short duration meant this was far more beneficial to rapid-fire guns than anything else.\nIncreased the effectiveness of the Incendiary proc but decreased its Duration\nDouble the damage per tick but half the duration; same total damage but in less time to feel more relevant.\nPulsar series\nIncreased base damage\nIncreased fall off range\nThese extremely precise weapons were having trouble competing with the other options available. Increased damage by about 10% and increased effective range should help give them a more viable role.\nPhotor series\nIncreased fall off range\nExtra range and these also benefit indirectly from the improvement to Incendiary status.\nCryophon series\nReduced damage and increased fall off range\nReducing the armor values of enemies made these capable of killing every enemy in a single hit, this brings them back in line with the intended time to kill. Please bear in mind we are actively watching player stats and collecting feedback, and are willing to iterate on balance. \nZetki House\nReduced Heat Accretion for all Zetki weapon variants apart from Cryophon\nThis house trades more heat for more damage, but it felt like they were TOO hot for the amount of extra damage you got.  Compared to the baseline weapons, Zetki now offers 50% more damage for double heat instead of quadruple heat.\nPermanent in-world markers have been added to Avionics and Salvage in Railjack when they drop.\nThis will allow you to always know what remains on the field of battle, and how to navigate accordingly. Adding awareness to the important loot has been a huge request, and this visibility increase should make sure no loot is left behind. Aside, we are reviewing ‘vacuum’ range. \nAsterite Resource pickups now reward 2x as much Asterite. \nAsterite costs for Wreckage were going a bit too slowly, so now you will earn it at twice the rate. \nYour Squad Overlay is now visible when in various Railjack modes (Pilot, Weapon, etc).\nThere’s been consistent expression that ‘seeing my Squad’s status’ is important. We have now ensured it’s visible when piloting / gunning / etc, and we have added some new iconography to show player states. \nAdded ‘Squad Status’ for Railjack Missions in the Squad Overlay. \nThese Icons show what your squadmates are doing, including: pilot, gunner, cannon, Omni Tool, Archwing, at a point of interest, engineering, fighting a boarding team, in slingshot, in Crewship, or just messing around on the Railjack doing nothing specific. \nIntrinsic points can no longer be gained once all available Intrinsics are maxed out. If you are already above the maximum, your additional points have not been lost. \nRailjack minimap is now always fully visible.\nBetter centered the Railjack Pilot HUD diamond. \nAdded new force feedback to all Weapons and Missile Launchers. \nOff-screen space enemy markers in Archwing now show awareness state fill.\nFixed some color and alpha settings on off-screen markers in Archwing for better visibility.\nIncreased brightness and thickness of enemy markers in Railjack. \nUpdated the Railjack name placement on all Skins to be better visible.\nSet the maximum length for Railjack Names to 50 characters \nin practice, this is almost an increase. The limit before was set by width along the available real estate. Now we have properly conforming names. . \nOptimized camera placements overall when customizing Railjack / viewing aspects. \nThe ‘Toggle Interior’ button now has a checkbox to indicate active state. \nRailjack Health and Shield now show when they are invulnerable (i.e after a Catastrophic Failure Breach). \nRemoved HUD markers from missiles launched by Seeker Volley battle avionic, which also fixed enemy HUD markers disappearing. \nThe player’s view of a Cloaked Railjack (using Void Cloak) is now a more obvious effect.\nRailjack name shows in ‘edit name’ input box.\nRailjack name shows in HUD instead of generic ‘Railjack’. \nCargo consoles now show a small effect when they are busy and unavailable to use. \nController ‘start’ button now closes tactical menu instead of opening top menu.\nSlightly zoomed out the tactical map when on the railjack, increased visibility of minimap features.\nSorting for Drain will now sort higher Drain to the top.\nAdded Wreckage count to equip screen.\nFixed Engines Colour customization not working properly. \nFixed an issue with Railjack stats appearing as the default one when pressing ESC on any part of Components menu.\nFixed missing sounds on a certain Archwing fly-in cinematic. \nFixed a script error in the Tactical Map. \nFixed erroneous ‘Stealth’ component from Railjack gun Huds. \nFixed Arrows for Railjack markers pointing the wrong way when you have a scaled HUD. \nFixed Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead spawning enemy ships inside Railjacks (lol). \nFixed an issue where using the Archwing Slingshot with Melee equipped causes issues. \nFixed an issue where you could use menus while in Archwing Slingshot. \nFixed the ‘Hijacked’ Grineer Crewship spawning inside geometry. \nFixed multiple [HC] tags appearing. \nFixed an issue where players entering Grineer Ramsleds could travel unknown places. \nFixed Ivara’s Zipline persisting when in Railjack Emplacements. \nFixed Railjack audio looping when in Landing Craft. \nFixed the Reliquary Void Branches not persisting. \nFixed Ballistic and Particle damage icons being swapped in-game. \nFixed Railjack Slingshot FX colour not updating properly. \nFixed Railjack Weaponry appearing at odd angles for Clients when dismounting. \nFixed Clients being permanently dead in Railjacks if they return to a Dojo in the ‘Revive’ screen. \nFixed Tactical views of players on Railjack Weaponry not working correctly. \nFixed overlapping music on mission complete. \nFixed being able to acquire Revolite by methods other than crafting / preparing Payloads.\nFixed Archwing death causing players to respawn at the beginning of the mission.\nFixed Omni tool equip animation causing loss of functionality when mounting emplacements/piloting.\nFixed Omni Tool having an ammo type (which didn’t actually interact with anything).\nFixed multiple crashes that could occur when loading into a mission as a client in a Landing Craft.   \nFixed Omni Tool showing level ‘0’.\nFixed being able to exit an emplacement without animations instantly by spamming esc multiple times.\nFixed railjack mission complete popup rendering behind the railjack HUD.\nFixed grineer Crewship console disabling the shield when exiting the hack without completing.\nFixed Crewship healing bubble not being seen or affected by clients.\nFixed Sigma Engines displaying incorrect stats.\nFixed some weapons showing incorrect icons.\nFixed railjack engineering 10 intrinsic not working for clients.\nFixed the repair drones not disappearing if someone else repairs the malfunction before the drones finish it.\nFixed drifting sound stopping properly when pilot leaves pilot seat during drifting.\nFixed bug where Intrinsics could be kept on mission abort, which was never intended.\nFixed Archwing bug that would cause Clients to be stuck with normal weapons if they slingshot into a non-Crewship enemy.\nOptimized Host-Migration speeds for Clients to be significantly faster. \nOptimized collision on Orokin Derelict Tentacles to better match current player movement skills. \nOptimized muzzle flash FX on the Zundi Pistol Skin\nCleaned up Sonicor light FX. \nTweaked Ivara Prime prowl effect to be less prominent while moving to reduce eye-strain based on feedback. \nDisable Y key triggering randomize appearance in arsenal to prevent accidental randomization\nThe Pennant has been removed from Conclave. \nRemoved redundant ‘Damage Blocked’ stat from Saryn’s Toxic Lash. \nRemoved a crate from extraction zone in Grineer Shipyard so it will stop taunting solo players who couldn’t get it.\nUpdated the background for Glyph dioramas in the market.\nAdded decos around Simaris targets so they are less likely to be mistaken for Thralls. \nOptimized Imperator projectiles to improve performance.\nOptimized performance in a section of the Kuva Fortress.\nShedu now uses its clip mesh when disarmed (the whole gun is too big!)\nAdded pickup text to Shedu and Euphona Prime.\nPrime Smite Infested and the Zylok are now tradeable. \nDisabled the new boss Health bar on Razorback because it was causing an issue. Razorback will now have it’s original Health bar.\nAdded long requested Wisp Walk, Run, and Sprint movement to Melee weapons, and fixed her movement when equipped with the Shedu.\n",

Wreckage can be scrapped for it, Avionics can be scrapped for it, and it can be found virtually everywhere in Railjack missions. Avionics are an important part of your Railjack customization and power experience, and are only found in a few places.\nFor this round of changes, we are doing the following:\nNext up on our list is Resources overall, universal Loot Pickup sharing, and more!\nCrewships now have their own unique enemy marker to differentiate them from all other fighters around!\nRemoved (for real this time) Credit Caches from the Railjack rewards, as the ‘bonus rewards’ still included Credits. \nElite Kosma Flaks will now only use their shield ability if facing their target.\nRemoved Resource collection sound for all items except: Carbides, Copernics, Cubic Diodes and Pustrels due to a constant stream of that specific sound because it happens for every single pickup. Sound is now reserved for important Forging Resources!\nFixed an exploit where Turret encounters would infinitely respawn despite not being intended to (nor Grineer having the means to generate infinite turrets, yet).\nFixed inability to complete a Railjack mission with a Pulse Turbine objective if a Host migration occurred, due to vulnerable radiators respawning and breaking the objective.\nFixes towards Clients taking a longer time than normal to load back into a Railjack mission after a Host migration has occurred. Clients will typically take longer than the Host to load back in, but hopefully this cuts down the load time a bit.\nFixed Armament Wreckage not showing their innate bonuses before and after Repair. The before Repair stats can be seen by selecting the Armament Wreckage and pressing TAB.\nFixed unequipping and equipping Railjack Components resulting in their upgrades stacking. \nFixed a potential script error with the Missile Platforms in Railjack missions. \nFixed a script error when using the Railjack Particle Ram.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed Octavia using the default songs for Clients.\nFixed Kubrow animations popping/jittering when returning to the Incubator after the menu is opened.\nFixes towards Syandana’s clipping through Excalibur Zato Skins body.\nFixed a script error when the Eidolon Teralyst screams.\nFixed a script error when casting numerous Archwing abilities.\nFixed a script error when casting numerous Warframe abilities.\n",

No hunt is complete without the Baza Prime and Aksomati Prime!\nAs regal and lethal as a nighttime wood, this is the queen of the hunt in her ultimate form.\nThe Orokin-engineered definition of silent lethality.\nThe elegant Aksomati precisely refined to its ultimate manifestation.\nYou can find Ivara Prime, Baza Prime, and Aksomati Prime Relics in their classic spots (Void, Derelict, Defense, Survival, etc) with the addition of Railjack missions \nAll Credit Cache Rewards have been replaced with Relics! Check your in-game Codex for Relic drop locations.\n\nGet the newest Prime gear with Ivara Prime Access and Prime Accessories here: https://www.warframe.com/prime-access\nWith this Vaulting comes the shift of the following Syndicate Sacrifices:\nIf you already wield the power of these Primes or have their Relics in your Inventory, they will remain after the Vaulting.\n\nAdded Railjack Health perks for performing repairs on the Railjack:\n15% of max Health for Fire and Electricity Traps\n20% of max Health for Ruptures\n30% of max Health for Hull Breaches\nCurrently a Hull Breach Repair grants you 10 seconds of Railjack invulnerability. With the added Health perk for Hull Breaches, we’ve tweaked the Railjack Invulnerability time to grant a benefit to those with haste to compensate! Repairing a Hull Breach now grants Railjack invulnerability scaled to the amount of time left on the ‘Catastrophic Failure Imminent' timer. You can get anywhere from 5 \n15 seconds of Railjack invulnerability based on your Hull Breach Repair urgency.\nRemoved Credit Caches from the Railjack reward table! Relics have been added in Railjack missions to compensate for this.\nIncreased the cooldown of the Elite Kosma Flak's Shield ability and fixed the shield not actually blocking damage sometimes.\nAdjusted hit boxes on the Elite Kosma Flak for improved accuracy. \nAdjustments to the Archwing Cannon firing animation for a less janky launch.\nRemoved a certain floating prison found in Railjack missions due to numerous collision/sizing issues.

  "fixes": "\nEmpyrean has arrived \nyour journey with your Railjack has just begun.\nWe’re here to answer one simple question for you: “How do I play Empyrean?”\nIf you have completed the ‘RISING TIDE’ Quest, you are ready. If not \nsquad up with a Railjack-ready Tenno, or begin the Quest yourself.\nEarth Proxima, Saturn Proxima, and Veil Proxima are destinations your Railjack can access with this Update. Things get harder the further from Earth you stray \nprepare yourself and your squad. It will take time to master your Railjack.\nEmpyrean brings the foundations of a new progression system \nINTRINSICS, as well as completely new Avionics, Gear, and Resources for you to earn and find. You and your crew will need to stay together to stay alive.\nThis is the beginning of Empyrean. War is coming.\nIs your Crew ready?\nThe Warframe Team\nHello, and thank you for flying with Warframe Empyrean! The following notes are your go-to manual and guide towards the success of your own Railjack experience. We’ve split the Empyrean category of the notes into 2 main sections:\nFinished “RISING TIDE”? The time has come to breathe life into your dormant Railjack. Enter your Railjack and proceed to the Reliquary located in the aft. From there you’ll initiate a mission to seek the missing piece before you can Take Flight… good luck, Tenno.\n\nThe base MK of each COMPONENT, (Shield Array, Engine, Reactor) and ARMAMENT (Nose Turret, Wing Turrets, and Ordnance) are available to Research. Once you have fully Researched the base MK, the next MK is unlocked for Research (with MK 3 being the max).\n\nEach WRECKAGE part has its own unique set of stats that can be applied, such as Status Effects, increased Fire Rate, etc. If you decide this WRECKAGE part is not needed in your Inventory you can choose to SCRAP it in 2 different ways:\nYou can have a capacity max of 30 WRECKAGE in your Inventory. Any new WRECKAGE obtained will be automatically scrapped for Dirac, so managing your Inventory and Repairing when able is important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Intrinsic Point Spent earns you 1,500 Mastery. If you complete 10 ranks in a given Intrinsic, that will be 15,000 Mastery. Months from now, if you complete 10 ranks in every Intrinsic, that will be 60,000 Mastery!\n*When the COMMAND Intrinsic launches in 2020, we will also offer a chance to rebalance your Intrinsic skills, thus refunding you all your spent Intrinsics to edit your skills however you please with the addition of COMMAND.\n\n\n\nA new selection of missions in the PROXIMA regions of planets and space have appeared.\nIf you don’t have a Railjack or are wanting to join another crew, you can do so using the “Join a Crew” toggle in the Star Chart. If you want to use your own Railjack, you can “Form a Crew” and host the mission by starting it from Navigation in your Railjack.\nYou can enter your Railjack from the Dry Dock itself, via the Railjack express console at the back of your Orbiter (located just outside the Personal Quarters area), or by accessing the “Board Railjack” option in the Menu from your Orbiter (option to “Return to Orbiter” is also available while on the Railjack!).\n\nChange your Warframe's Loadout before taking flight by accessing the Arsenal located within your Railjack, across from the boarding port.  The Arsenal is disabled once you have taken off, so select the best gear for the mission before hand.\nSOVER STRAIT\nPOSIT CLUSTER \nMINHAST STATION \nPHANGHOUL SATELLITES\nIOTA TEMPLE \nJEX LANES\nOGAL CLUSTER\nKORMS BELT\nRIAN BELT\nBENDAR CLUSTER\nMORDO CLUSTER\nKASIO'S REST\nVILA GAP\nSPIRO GAP\nNODO GAP\nLUPAL PASS\nVAND CLUSTER\nRYA\nFLEXA\nGIAN POINT\nRUSE WAR FIELD\nNSU GRID\nGANALEN'S GRAVE\nH-2 CLOUD\nR-9 CLOUD\nThere are 3 Turrets aboard this Railjack.

Towards the top aft of the Railjack holds your Archwing Catapult that Gunnery Intrinsic Rank 3 will be able to access!\n\nThese Warframe Ability drops require Flux Energy at the cost of your Railjacks Flux Energy pool \nso use wisely! Those with a top tier Tactical Intrinsic rank will see reduced Flux Energy costs and reduced cooldown times.\nIf you fail to extinguish all the fires with haste, a Hull Breach will occur! Hull Breaches are represented in the minimap as red flame icons as opposed to normal fires which are orange. A Hull Breach is serious business, and Cy isn’t messing around when he says that critical failure is imminent. Once fires and Hull Breaches have been fully extinguished the Railjacks Health will be restored! If Hull Breaches are not extinguished within the given time on the UI, the mission will fail.\n\nAll Resources earned in Railjack missions that are not spent Forging will be awarded upon a successful End of Mission!\nIsos\nAucrux Capacitors\nGallos Rods\nKomms\nTrachons\nBracoid\nKesslers\nFresnels\nTitanium\nNullstones\nAsterite\nComponents and Armaments from The Old War exist as WRECKAGE in the Proxima regions. Find these and Repair them to use them! You can Repair these by contributing Resources, like in the Foundry but done in the Dry Dock, or instantly with a Repair Rush Drone.\nAVIONICS are your key to Upgrading your Railjack. Obtain these to increase your offensive, defense, and tactical prowess! These can be upgraded with DIRAC (below). Avionics drop from Railjack enemies in space \ndestroy them for your Avionics! \nOver 60 Avionics are out there \nfind them all, Tenno!\nIntroduced in Update 26: The Old Blood, bring 10 of these to Palladino for a Riven! Limited to 1 Riven per week.\nPlayers have often requested an alternate path to obtain Forma Blueprints. Forma Blueprints can be found within the rewards of Railjack!\nDirac is a powerful Resource that makes your Avionics and Railjack stronger. Use it to Upgrade your Railjack’s Grid and Avionics!\nThe deeper you venture into the unknown, the greater the quality of the reward!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed being able to start the Rising Tide quest before completing Second Dream if you set it as your active quest from the World State Window.\nFixed inability to Install Cephalon Cy in the Dry Dock after initiating the Rising Tide quest while in the Dojo.\nFixed a loss of functionality when attempting to modify your Parazon on another players Orbiter.\nFixed Kuva Lich having the attention span of a squirrel when surrounded by Nidus’ Maggots.\nFixed Kuva not appearing Taxed on the End Of Mission screen.\nFixed the World State Window's \"Next Objective\" panel directing players to the the Mars->Ceres Junction before Mars->Phobos Junction.\nFixed Grineer Guardsmen blocking 100% of damage.\nFixed enemies like Sentients being put into a ‘lifted status’ and playing wonky or popping animations because they weren't set up to ragdoll or rise from ragdoll.\nFixed Ancient Healer Specters not teleporting to players in Orb Vallis or Plains of Eidolon.

  "additions": "Added 2 new in-game Challenges:\nWe're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat: Enter the Dry Dock.\nSome Assembly Required: Assemble a Railjack.\n",
  "changes": "Rising Tide: Update 26.1:\n\nThe balance of power is tipping.  An imminent threat grows stronger, surging across the Origin System. Will you stand against it? Keep pace in the arms race by starting construction on your Clan’s Dry Dock!\nBuild the Dry Dock, assemble your Railjack and prepare for the coming battle. What will begin as a hangar will evolve into your sanctuary, a space to hone and upgrade your ship with powerful technology to become the weapon you’ll need. Build the Dry Dock by rallying your clan and contributing Resources to its construction. After that, if you have completed the Second Dream Quest, start the Rising Tide Quest to begin forging your Railjack.\n\n\nThe Grineer threat is mounting and you must rise to meet it. Track down the pieces of a long destroyed Railjack and breathe new life into it with the help of the newest Cephalon, Cy!\nTime has not been kind to the Railjacks. You’ll need to work with Cephalon Cy to find viable salvage from wreckage across the Origin System. After Cephalon Cy is installed in the Dry Dock, locate the six necessary Railjack components, retrieve them, then return back to the Dry Dock to restore them to glory. Once your Railjack is rebuilt, you’ll be able to board and explore your ship. Ignition and flight command requires additional components, which have yet to be located by Cephalon Cy.\nThis update previews new Resources for future update EMPYREAN! When Empyrean launches, a wide variety of Railjack Specific resources will launch in missions, but we are previewing 4 new Resources early to aid in the construction of your Railjack:\nEximus Units will Drop 2 of the new Resources:\nCubic Diodes = Eximus units on *Europa Ice Planet tileset\nCarbides = Eximus units on *Ceres Shipyard tileset\n*We've added clarification that the Shipyard tileset on Ceres and Europa Ice Planet tileset on Europa are the nodes that will yield these new Resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoubled the amount of Critical Chance on Melee Rivens and gave the Critical Chance 2x for Heavy Melee.\nAmalgam Ripkas changed to 187% Critical Chance (x2 for Heavy Attacks).\nTrue Punishment changed to 100% Additional Combo Count Chance, -50% Combo Duration.\nRank 1, 2, 3, and 4 Liches now drop Kuva for all squad members when a Parazon is used on them \nwhether that leads to defeat or ranking up, the Kuva is yours on Ranks 1 through 4! You will recall there was a brief window where Thralls could drop Kuva or a Requiem Relic. We removed the Kuva, and are now applying it to Liches. Kuva numbers are balanced against Siphons / Kuva Survival missions, and take into account the fact that multiple Liches spawn in missions. The aim is to not make this the best Kuva run, just an added value. Siphons and other missions are meant to be the optimal path. Rank 5 Liches do not have Kuva as a drop as they could intentionally be kept alive for a vector to acquire Kuva. The Drops are: Rank 1: 150, Rank 2:  200, Rank 3: 250, Rank 4: 300. This is lower than some other discussed numbers because we are now letting it share across Squadmates. \nLiches now run away (but don’t rank up) if you’ve downed them 3 times, but don’t use your Parazon on them. This allows you to overpower your Lich and have it flee, instead of having the only way to remove it from a Mission be your failure to know a Requiem.\n\nOperators can no longer perform Mercy kills on Larvling or Kuva Lich. Your Warframe is armed with the Parazon for a reason!\nMore fixes towards Requiem Mod UI lingering on the screen perpetually after failing to Parazon stab the Kuva Lich.\nFixed issue with Requiem Mod UI lingering and not updating properly after performing a Mercy on Kuva Lich as Wisp.\nFixed Kuva Lich despawning after getting downed while temporarily friendly from Revenant's Enthrall.\nFixed issues with the Vanquish / Convert context action appearing on Kuva Liches for Clients.\nFixed Kuva Lich weapons showing as fully Mastered in player Profile before hitting rank 40. Affected accounts should now see the corrected Mastered status based on progress.\nFixed Kuva Lich weapons not being localized in the End Of Mission results screen if you abort or look at last mission results.\nFixed Kuva Lich screen overlapping with the Market UI if the Market is opened while viewing said Kuva Lich screen.\nARCH LINE has replaced Itzal’s Blink ability:Launch a tethered hook that either pulls enemies close, or pulls the Warframe towards any stationary objects it hooks onto.\nImproved handling of alt-tab when fullscreen, particularly when using the experimental flip-mode optimizations. Please try it again if you had problems before! Please note that there are known issues with Experimental Optimized Flip-Mode when using on cloned displays.\nMade the optimized flip-model work if you booted up in native fullscreen before switching to borderless or windowed.\nImproved diagnostics for GPU-driver crashes (we now send you to the website for help).\nOptimized batch removal of friends to reduce server load.\nMade some micro-optimizations to screens with a button-bar.\nMade some micro-optimizations to the categorized grid UI.\nMade some micro-optimizations to the Mod and Upgrade screens.\nMade some micro-optimizations to certain UI scripts.\nMade some micro-optimizations to sorting Mods by \"recent\".\nAdded a projectile explosion range FX to Garuda’s Dread Mirror blood projectile for the local player (one doing the casting) so you can see your output.\nSlight trim to the Bloodletting cast animation.\nBloodletting now gives 35% Energy instead of 25%.\nReduced Seeking Talons charge time by around 15%.\nIncreased Seeking Talons Status Chance from 50 to 75%.\nFixed motion blur on Garuda's Dread Mirror.\nIncreased maximum Dojo Room capacity from 100 to 128 to accommodate for the new Crimson Branch and Dry Dock additions!\nAdded a new Captura Orbiter Scene so you can finally take a family photo with you and your 99 Domestik Drones \nnow with a new skylight!\nWe now allow the use of Skins on Zaws \nthis 2 year old request is finally seeing the light of day after some under-the-hood restructuring. If you come across any issues with Exodia, or odd behaviours, please let us know! Skin compatibility is automatically determined by Strike! \nRestored Mirage’s Eclipse granting its ‘light’ buff when Mirage is on fire AND when under the effect of an Electricity Status Effect.\nCapatilized Ember’s name in her Inferno ability description.\n",

  "changes": "The Old Blood: Hotfix 26.0.7:\nWe are several Hotfixes into ‘The Old Blood’, and we’ve got a sizeable amount of tweaks to add to the pile:\n\nVoid Fissure Missions will now appear on all Kuva Fortress nodes! Previously, only Rescue/Survival missions on the Kuva Fortress were eligible due to other missions having an Archwing restriction; now the whole Fortress is eligible! \nA bug now turned feature; Ephemera’s obtained from a Kuva Lich can now be equipped on Sentinels and Companions! For FX sake, this will be a slightly subdued version of the selected Ephemera. Non-Lich Ephemera functionally is in the works! \nIncreased the chance of your Kuva Lich to have an Ephemera from 5% to 10%. Newly birthed Liches will have the 10% chance, while existing Liches will still be at 5%. Old Liches that are traded and \"reactivated\" will also be at 5%.\nAdded new Parazon finishers for you to stabby stab the baddies with! \nAdded a Kuva Lich icon beside Star Chart regions/nodes that are under the influence of your Kuva Lich to address color blind concerns regarding the ‘Kuva Stain’.\nIncreased the base damage (before elemental bonus) of the Kuva Ogris from 454 to 714.\nGrineer Prosecutors will no longer spawn as Thralls, as they were essentially invincible to everything except area-of-effect abilities.\nGhoul Expired will no longer spawn as a Thrall due to their suicide death mechanic. \nRemoved Pigments from the list of eligible items the Kuva Lich can Tax.\nRemoved rewards obtained specifically from completing a Junction from the list of eligible items the Kuva Lich can Tax.\nReduced the camera shake of the Kuva Ayanga explosions.\nFixed Kuva Lich weapons that do damage on both impact and explosion (Kuva Ogris, Kuva Ayanga, etc) doing significantly less overall damage than expected. This was due to the Elemental bonus only being applied to the \"on impact\" of the projectile itself and not the explosion.\nFixed Kuva Siphon/Flood Rescue missions not giving out a Requiem Relic at End Of Mission if you completed the mission without setting off the alarms.\nFixed Kuva Siphon/Flood Spy missions not giving rewards for cracking the Spy vaults.\nConverted Kuva Lich allies will no longer spawn in Archwing missions, as they ignore the complete lack of oxygen and requirements needed to fly.

There are also two issues we are looking to solve in a calculated and better thought-out way to avoid the scenario we created yesterday with fixing a bug. The first issue is making the co-operative aspect of Lich hunting rewarding, and the second is treating the condition of downing your Lich (despite not having the right Requiems) have a different flow in a mission.  Thank you for your patience!",

Enemies already inflicted by any Heat Status effect will now take additional damage.\nFireball has a casting combo, if you use it multiple times rapidly it gets stronger.\nThe damage output and charge speed also scale off of one of Ember’s newest abilities...\nTime for a history lesson! Prior to Update 11.5, Ember’s second ability used to be “Overheat”, offering an aura of heat damage which also protected her from enemy fire. Almost SIX years later, it’s time for this ring of fire to come full circle.\nWhen cast, Ember Immolates herself with protective fire armor. Her current level of self-Immolation is indicated by a unique UI indicator; the higher the heat, the more damage resistance, and the more effective Ember’s other abilities become.\nThe Immolation meter will build slowly at first \nusing Ember’s Fireball or Inferno causes the meter to build faster. But be warned! If the meter reaches maximum, Ember will “overheat” and Immolation will cost progressively more energy per second the longer you stay in an overheated state. To prevent this from happening, use Fire Blast to expel a portion of your heat meter, or toggle Immolation off to reset meter build.\nCasting time has been greatly reduced, and the ability now strips armor from nearby enemies. The amount of armor removed scales in effectiveness based on current Immolation levels. On cast, this immediately reduces your Immolation level by up to half.\nUpon casting Inferno, all enemies currently within sight are struck by a fiery comet, lighting each target ablaze in a personal ring of fire. Inferno costs Energy per each target in sight, with the cost capped at 10 targets, at which other enemies are then free.\nIf an enemy ignited by Inferno comes in contact with another unit, the fire will spread, igniting them as well with a fresh ability duration. Damage of the heat AoE scales with current Immolation level.\nWith these changes, players will take a more active role in “bringing the heat” to all that stand in their way, with added protection that encapsulates Ember’s volatile nature.\n\n\nWhen revisiting Vauban, we aimed to retain his status as a crowd control powerhouse, while increasing his mobility and lethality to keep up with 2019 Warframe’s lightning-quick pace.\nInstead of sticking to surfaces, these new Tesla Drones will roll around, following the player. Once an enemy comes within range, these Drones will latch on and emit a shock that stuns the target and nearby enemies. Each Drone has a limited number of shock charges before it must be replaced. Hold cast to summon multiple Tesla Nervoses at once!\nAll four of his mines have been replaced with new options:\nA deployable beacon marks a location on the map. After a short countdown, the area is struck by a massive orbital laser explosion (and yes, it does work indoors).\nVauban’s two marquee powers have been combined into a new and devastating ultimate ability!\nWhen deployed, a Bastille will capture nearby enemies, stripping them of their armor over time. Players standing within a Bastille’s radius will gain a temporary armor increase, building up over time based on how many targets are currently being held in the Bastille.\nWhen a Bastille’s duration expires, it collapses into a brief Vortex at the center of the cast for easy group kills. Want the Vortex to appear sooner, or last longer? Holding the cast key will collapse all active Bastilles early, or if you have no Bastilles, holding will deploy a new Vortex instead.\nOverall, many of Vauban’s powers have been streamlined or replaced, making his tools less redundant, and much more versatile for keeping up with the pace of an average Warframe mission.\n*Vauban and Ember have been removed from Conclave in the meantime for balancing.\n\n\nThe trappings of royalty. Includes the deluxe Titania Empress Skin, Hawkmoth Skin for the Dex Pixia exalted weapon, the Mot Skin for the Diwata sword, Titania’s Heartwood Armor Set and the Dendrite Gunblade Skin.\n\n\nContains Euphrates Pet Armor for both Kubrow and Kavat, modeled on the intimidating, bladed look of the Tigris Shotgun.\n\nIntroducing Vasca! A true child of the night, and a drinker of life.\nBring your Kavat to the Plains of Eidolon at night to meet a Vasca Kavat \nsnoot to snoot. If your Kavat becomes tainted by a Vasca bite, Imprint it and breed 2 together for your own bloodthirsty kitty.\nDon’t want your Kavat to carry the virus? Visit Master Teasonai in Cetus for the Vasca Curative.\nPLUS, new Vasca Floofs can be acquired by Master Teasonai!\nDon’t feel like getting in a cat fight? Check out the Market for the Vasca Kavat Starter Kit!\n\n\nIntroducing a new Exilus Weapon Adapter that unlocks an Exilus Weapon Mod Slot for your Primary and Secondary weapons, granting you extra capacity to equip utility Mods. You can find the Exilus Weapon Adapter as an Offering from the main 6 Syndicates, from the new Requiem Relics, or in the in-game Market!\nThese Adapters will be for Primary and Secondary weapons only. Once we have finished making changes to the Melee system, we will re-evaluate the need for a Melee variant.\nThe conversation of tight capacity already exists without the addition of the Exilus Weapon Mod Slot, so we’re making these Slots default Polarities, meaning all Exilus Weapon Mods are \n(Naramon) or V (Madurai) Polarity.\nIf you’re familiar with Exilus Mods, they are utility or movement Mods, not sustained DPS grants. Below is a list of eligible Exilus Weapon Mods that sustain the utility intention. Anything not included in this list was deemed DPS affecting and not true ‘Utility’:\nAmmo Drum\nShell Compression\nTrick Mag\nRifle Ammo Mutation\nPrimed Rifle Ammo Mutation\nShotgun Ammo Mutation\nPrimed Shotgun Ammo Mutation\nPistol Ammo Mutation\nPrimed Pistol Ammo Mutation\nArrow Mutation\nSniper Ammo Mutation\nVIGILANTE: Supplies\nEagle Eye\nBroad Eye\nOverview\nAir Recon\nAERO: Periphery\nAgile Aim\nSnap Shot\nSpry Sights\nGun Glide\nDouble-Barrel Drift\nStabilizer\nVile Precision\nStrafing Slide\nSteady Hands\nGuided Ordnance\nNarrow Barrel\nTargeting Subsystem\nHush\nSilent Battery\nSuppress\nSoft Hands\nTwitch\nReflex Draw\nLock and Load\nTactical Reload\nEject Magazine\nTerminal Velocity\nFatal Acceleration\nLethal Momentum\nAdhesive Blast\nCautious Shot\nFomorian Accelerant\nKinetic Ricochet\nTether Grenades\nAs a result, the following Mods have been tweaked:\nAmmo Drum increased to +90% Ammo\nShell Compression increased to +90% Ammo \nVile Precision is now -90% Recoil\nLock and Load from 13 to 9\nTactical Reload from 13 to 9\nEject Magazine from 13 to 9\nVile Precision from 11 to 9\nCautious Shot from 12 to 10\nRifle Ammo Mutation from 9 to 7\nPrimed Rifle Ammo Mutation from 14 to 10\nShotgun Ammo Mutation from 9 to 7\nPrimed Shotgun Ammo Mutation from 14 to 10\nArrow Mutation from 9 to 7\nPistol Ammo Mutation from 9 to 7\nPrimed Pistol Ammo Mutation from 14 to 10\nSniper Ammo Mutation from 9 to 7\n\nUpdate 26 brings change to Warframe \nit iterates on the game and Melee is no exception. For months Phase 1 has been in your hands, and it’s time for Phase 2. What follows is a detailed overview of our design direction and intentions with this new Phase.\nWe are not touching Melee Riven Dispositions until we get updated data \nexpect advance notice when we close in on a date for this.\nWe want you to know how your use of melee and feedback on the systems have helped form Phase 2, and how some changes are included to allow for a more cohesive Melee experience. Our tools made Spin attacks optimal at the cost of the more interesting Melee system, and we’re trying to rectify that overall.\nPreviously we made several changes to the Melee system (as detailed in the Melee Rework Phase 1 Dev Workshop thread) including:\nIntroducing a new quick-melee attack\nFull VFX overhaul on elemental damage types\nAimed Slam Attacks instead of impacting directly below an airborne player.\nWhile select changes are to be rolled back (yes \nsee below before you react), the rest of the system served as a good foundation for this much more expansive Phase 2.\nPlease bear in mind that these changes are not set in stone, and some aspects of the new Melee system will be tweaked during the usual QA process. There are some more features being added later on, introduced in Melee Rework Phase 3 at a later date.\nSo what is covered in Melee Update Phase 2?\nThe Return of Equipped Melee and Manual Blocking!\nDodge Cancelling and Tactical Dodging\n3.            Stance Changes, Combos and You!\n4.            Smoother Combo Transitions\n5.            Combo Counter Rework\n6.            Changes to Slam Attacks\n7.            Goodbye Channeling, Hello Heavy Attacks and Lifting!\n8.            Weapon Stats, Mastery Limits and General Melee Changes\n9.            Mod Rebalancing / Functionality\n10.          Exalted Weapons\n11.          The Screens: Arsenal Changes\n12.          Aim Assist\n13.          Sticky Fingers when Equipping Melee!\n14.          Channelling 2.0 AKA “Rage Mode” and Future Plans!\nAs you can probably tell, this section is going to be a bit of a lengthy one, so make sure you sit comfortably, drink a nice cup of Greedy Milk and get ready to read all about how you can better turn your enemies into salsa with your favorite melee weapon!\nAn overarching note before you get started, is that every Melee weapon that was originally a single Elemental damage type has been converted to Physical + Element, allowing for more Status reliability as well (Silva and Aegis excluded given Flame Blade).\n\nOne of the bigger changes added to the Melee Rework: Phase 1 was the addition of fluid swapping between melee and Primary / Secondary Weapons. However, some players preferred the ability to manually block, making some of their builds less easy to manage. While we restored manual blocking for players playing ‘sword alone’, it wasn’t quite the same.\nThe good news is that both functions are back! Holding the weapon swap button will equip melee fully again, and the aim button will manually block when in this mode. Holding the Weapon Swap button while Exalted Melee is in play will also lock you into Exalted Melee mode! (Don’t worry, Auto Blocking is still a thing!)\nWe also have redesigned the utility of blocking: Blocking will now prevent 100% of damage,  with a blocking angle that is dependent on the melee weapon equipped. All successful Blocks will also add to the new Combo Counter!\n\n\n\nIn the above example, sword and shield weapons (such as the Silva & Aegis) have a blocking angle of 70 degrees, centered on the front of the player, where as a dagger weapon (such as the Dark Dagger) will only have a blocking angle of 45 degrees. (Previously all weapons had a locked blocking angle of 45 degrees upon the introduction of Auto Blocking.)\n\nOne of the older and larger complaints of the melee combo system has been the animation locks. Completing 7 step combos feels great, but the animations completely lock you into the movements. We are introducing two new ways to put more control in your hands:\n\nBy far, the biggest change you will see in the new Melee system is the alterations made to Stances, as well how Combos interact with one another. In the old (current) system, Combos are an effect of button presses, all leading into a chain of animations. In Melee Rework Phase 2, attacks are buttery-smooth and adaptable!\nThis rework of Combos applies to every Stance, not just the weapon types. For example, Tempo Royale (a Heavy Weapon Stance Mod) will still have different Combos than the Cleaving Whirlwind Stance, even though both Stances fit the Heavy Weapon melee type. The difference now, is that both share a design that uses common movements and attack types.\nWe also wanted melee attacks to feel more intuitive. For example, if you are aiming down the sights of a primary weapon or blocking incoming fire, and then hit the melee button, you most likely want to get in close! If you are not inputting a movement key while meleeing, it’s usually a sign you want to finish off your target. We wanted the new Combos to reflect that that existing movement, and so the new inputs reflect that situational awareness.\nIn most cases, the following improvements can be applied to any given Stance Mod equipped to a weapon (not just individual weapon types!):\nAll of these fresh Stance changes has shone light on Whip Stances in particular not being as desirable in comparison to the others. We’re aware of this and are working on a new Whip Stance!\n\nIn the old system, only the first follow up attack inputted would remain in ‘memory’ and would execute at the end of the initial attack animation. Any kind of input entered after the initial follow up was ignored until the next attack had started. In the new system, the next attack is being constantly updated, depending on the last input received.\nThis allows for last-second decisions on combo changes to occur immediately after the first attack has finished. No more waiting for a combo attack animation to end before you can start spamming the attack button again! Embrace the fluidity!\n\nThe Combo Counter will be getting a new functionality pass. Rather than just providing flat bonuses to damage, the Combo Counter will now also act as an expendable resource for new heavy hitting combat: HEAVY ATTACKS! This will replace channeling's key binding, and Section 7 below covers those changes. This counter will be increased in a more granular and rapid way, and can be built by using melee attacks, blocking damage, radial damage from Slam Attacks and hits from a thrown weapon (such as the Glaive).\nAs an expendable resource the Combo Counter should be easy to replenish, and the changes made should reflect how easy you can acquire and spend the Combo Counter resource. In addition, the ‘heaviness’ of an attack will have a measured difference on the amount of Combo Counter it increases. As a general rule, lighter, swift attacks will give lower additions to the Combo Counter than slower, heavy attacks will. Swing for the fences, Tenno!\nCombo Duration is now displayed as a bar underneath your Combo Counter!\n\nThe ragdoll effect of the Slam Attack is being removed (with some weapon-specific exceptions *cough*JatKittag*cough*), however it is being replaced with an effect that will push enemies back or knock them down, giving the player some breathing room, and setting the enemy units up for follow-up attacks.\nMelee Rework: Phase 1 introduced the global use of ragdoll effects on Slam Attacks, so this is the second item to be rolled back, and replaced with a better way to rain down death from above!\nAlso, all Melee weapons have received an updated Slam FX \ncome on and SLAM (attack), and welcome to the jam!\n\nChanneling will be saying its final farewells in the Melee Rework: Phase 2 update, and instead is being replaced with a new form of Heavy Attack, as well as a new Lifted status effect. As we said before, Channeling Mods will also be changed to support this new system, as well as providing a larger pool of utility to choose from in your builds.\nThese are the changes planned:\nBut what about the Channeling FX you ask? Prime Armor Channeling FX will now appear when the Combo Counter reaches 2!\n\nWith this new change, there is a broad-sweeping review of Melee weapons and how they function with the new system:\n\nSince the base damage of melee is being buffed, some notable Mods are getting a balance and/or functionality pass. With the wide amount of changes happening to Channeling and Heavy Attacks, some Mods have had to be reworked into other systems or have had changes to the way their damage scales.\nFor full transparency, some of these are nerfs to specific Mods, but we felt these were necessary to truly allow Phase 2 to be treated as a new beginning for melee. Our intention is to create engaging melee and Modding variety, which is not possible when there is a one-best loadout or single Mod that can kill almost anything in the game. We love killing things effectively, but we also want the combat to be engaging and feel powerful. Spin attacks still exist, but the repetition of them is something we’re trying not to force you to use. To reiterate: select tools made Spin attacks optimal at the cost of the more interesting Melee system, and we’re trying to rectify that.\nAt the moment, the current list of Mods and their proposed changes are listed below.\nThis update will also see some changes to the following Weapon, Arcane and Focus School buffs:\nAgain, some of these changes are subject to review and change. Now that Melee Rework: Phase 2 has been rolled out, there will surely be additional balance passes as usability and effectiveness are used (or abused).\n\nAll melee-based Exalted Weapons have received the Phase 2 functionality treatment, gaining access to the combo changes. For those of you who may have missed it, Wukong’s Exalted Iron Staff has already had this functionality implemented (with the exception of the new Heavy Attacks and changes to the Slam Attacks).\n\nPart of Update 26 involves a change of the Arsenal Screen, and how information is displayed. In the current system, your Arsenal screen looks something like this:\n\n\nIn Update 26, this screen is being reorganized to include Loadouts, Companions and Vehicles in tabs, while also giving more information about a weapon when selected:\n\n\nAs you can see, new stats for Heavy Attacks and Heavy Slam have been added, with channeling statistics removed.\n\nAim assist can be a help or a hindrance depending on what type of attack you wish to perform. While the current system either applies to all or none (on or off), the new system will have more intelligence on aim assist on a per-attack basis. As a general rule under the new system, Aim Assist will be disabled for almost all attacks in the Forward and Tactical Forward Combos, and enabled for most of the Neutral and Tactical Neutral Combo attacks. Of course if you don’t wish to use aim assist at all, you can disable it from the settings menu as normal.\n\nAnother common issue in user feedback was the unequipping of Gear Items (like the Codex Scanner), or dropping the ‘football’ (usually a pickup for Mobile Defense or Sabotage Missions) when equipping melee or using a melee attack. This has now been changed so that you will no longer drop items or unequip Gear Items when either equipping melee or using a Melee Attack!\nThere has been a lot of discussion around this addition, and while it will not be included in the Phase 2 update, there is a lot of work being put into its application. This system is very special and we want to make sure that it is not just a cool addition, but that it has roots in Warframes lore, and a story behind it. This is something we want to implement with a lot of in-game fanfare and details will become available as progress is made.\nFor now, that’s it!\n\nSome time has passed since our recent Arbitration tweaks \nafter observing stats and listening to your feedback, here are our findings and plans going forward:\n-The initial purpose of the changes, rebalancing the different mission types, was a success! Vitus Essence output is now more consistent across the board when tracking earnings per mission type.\n-We heard your thoughts regarding the droptables, especially the points about Mod drops. We think there is value to having both purchasable offerings as well as luck-based drops, but we can see how these items “diluting” Endo drops would be a concern.\nWe are addressing this desire for more consistent Endo from two angles:\nDue to the addition of Vitus Essence dropping from Drones, overall Vitus earnings are..... higher than we anticipated. We've decided to leave these values as-is, but will be closely watching the impact Arbitrations has on Kuva economy overall.\n\n\nReduced the number of Kavor Defector squads required for a reward in Defection Arbitration missions to match other mission types.\nReward is now every 2 Defector squads instead of every 4 squads\nAdded a Vitus Essence Decoration to the Arbitration Honors Store.\nTweaked the Vitus pickup FX to be larger and red.\nFixed Vitus pickups sometimes falling through the floor.\nIf you’ve made it to this part of the Update notes, you’re well aware that a lot of the Warframe meta may shift in new directions. With the current path Catchmoon weapons are on, it was time to bring Catchmoon weapons to a more reasonable power level, while still keeping them effective.\nDecreased fall off damage from 100 to 10.\nDecreased range of projectile from 40m to 20m and fall off range from 20-30m to 8-16m.\nPlease note that we are monitoring item usage for other weapons who use similar projectiles (Fulmin / Arca Plasmor), but will provide notice before we consider changing anything. We are simply monitoring at this phase.\n\nHeat Status procs now reduce targets' armor to 50% of the original value, with subsequent Heat procs refreshing the duration. Not hot enough for you? Applying the Status proc multiple times also turns up the Heat, dealing more damage per tick as the flames increase.\n\nTitania can now Transfer to the Operator during Razorwing.\nTitania’s cast animations are now an upper body animation only (except Razorwing), alleviating momentum cancelling lower body animations and trimming cast time.\nThorns Tribute now has Damage reflected AND reduced to help our little bug feel a little less squishy.\nTitania can spawn up to four more Razorflies if all Tributes are active, one per Tribute.\nRazorflies can now pick up Tributes.\nEnemies directly affected by Titania’s Lantern will now have any damage they take dealt to them when the Ability ends (a la Mind Control).\nOur goal with changes to tonemapping is to alleviate fatiguing images by introducing darker midtones. Things may appear more washed out in contrast to how it was before, but don’t worry, it’s all intentional. If you spot things that are out of the ordinary and real wack, please let us know!\n\n\n\n\nThe Options screen, Ayatan Treasures screen, and Dojo Room Options UI have received a fresh new look!\nThe loading screen now puts your Liset at the forefront in a new formation!\nTekko Prime now gains additional Status Chance when used with Atlas and/or Atlas Prime.\nBase status = 10%, Prime = 26%\nEach Kavat can now give you 3 Imprints (up from 2). This will apply to all Kavats that predate this update. If you’ve already used 2, you'll find 1 more ready to go!\nYou can now enter your own Dojo from the Clan screen when visiting someone else's Dojo, instead of having to return to your Orbiter first.\nYou can now double-click on a Dojo Decoration to place it, rather than being required to select a Decoration and hit the Place Decoration button.\nIncreased volume of Lua Rescue Alarm as per player feedback.\nPressing ‘enter’ in the Loadout selection while using the search box will now equip the first Loadout in the resulting grid.\nIncreased the Exposing Harpoon duration from 10 seconds to 15 seconds.\nSwapped the Kuva Bombard Crimson Dervish and 80 Endo drop to Condition Overload.\nAllies will no longer attack Synthesis Targets, thus giving you full control on if you want to Scan.\nWeapon stats will now be reflected in a slightly more rounded way. Innate Damage is added before anything on the weapon happens \nboosting the weapons base Damage and then renormalizes the Damage percentages. This makes Elemental Mods stack in a way you would expect.\nMoved the ‘Tips’ section in the Arsenal Upgrade screens to the button bar at the bottom.\nIncreased the ‘Additional Item Drop Chance’ of certain Amalgam enemies from 2% to 4% due to discovery that this drop was broken (fixed below). Happy hunting! \nThe Riven Cycle screen now gives you the option to view the Riven stats on every owned variant of said weapon. For example, I can now select either my normal Lex or my Lex Prime to view it’s said Stats.\n\n",

Changed Energy per meter stat into Energy per second: unmodded Energy drain remains the same, and while speed Mods previously increased Energy drain (more distance covered), they now no longer do.

Currently, our statistics are looking at the effects of adding Vitus to Drones, reward balance between different mission types, and the overall reward output, comparing Arbitrations both before and after changes.

  "changes": "Arbitrations Revisited: Hotfix 25.7.6:\nLast week we released a Dev Workshop (link on those words: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1128051-arbitrations-revisited-part-2/) outlining our plans to improve Arbitrations, revisiting the droptables and improving reward frequency to be more consistent between modes. From new players who just completed the Star Chart, to veterans returning for new Arcanes and Aura mods, we hope these changes result in a more satisfying gameplay experience overall.\nAll changes are potentially subject to later changes based on feedback, so try out a few mission types and tell us your thoughts!\nIn the original Arbitrations, Excavation missions were the clear outlier in terms of reward output for time spent. The following changes are intended to bring all other missions to the same level as Excavation, and also iterate on other community feedback:\nArbitrations now use regular rotation length for their rewards, with the exception of Excavation. Excavation timers have been adjusted to compensate. Example:\nEX: In lieu of a reward every 10 waves of Defense, you will now receive a reward every 5 waves.\nArbitration rotation cadence has been changed from “ABCCCCC...” to “AABBCCCCC...”, so that the same level of time investment is encouraged.\nReduced Endo Rewards drop percentage in the drop tables. Rare non-endo reward drop rates are unchanged \nyou’ll just get twice as many chances!\nArbiter Drones will now have a small chance to drop Vitus Essence on kill.\nVitus Essence dropped by destroyed Arbitration drones will have the special pickup notification.\nGhoul Purge inbox messages will no longer automatically open your inbox or play the transmissions if you have completed all of the Encrypted Journal Fragments. \nTweaked weather patterns in the Plains of Eidolon to prevent lengthy rainy periods. \nIncreased brightness of Ash’s Bladestorm mark slightly to improve visibility.\nAlly NPCs will no longer attack Garuda’s Blood Atlar Victims.\nUpdated Umbral Forma’s description to properly reflect the items it can be installed on (Warframes and Melee Weapons). Removed the ability to use Umbral Forma on K-Drives and Archwing Melee.\nTweaks Ostron eyes to make them less glowy.\nLimited Shawzin to 30 notes per second to prevent macros playing ridiculous amounts of notes and causing issues. \nEnemies may now “react” (without changing their Alert state) to you by stopping and looking around if you shoot a Silent weapon within 2-3m of them several times quickly. \nApplying a Look Link to the same item (ex: a Nova Look Link applied to a Nova) that uses default colours will now properly apply the default color.
